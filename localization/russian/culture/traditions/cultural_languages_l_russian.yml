Это диалект с наибольшим влиянием валарин, но в остальном самый консервативный из диалектов, посколько они были менее новаторскими, чем нолдор.\n\nКвенья Изгнанников (также известная как квенья нолдор), на которой говорили [noldorelvesexiles|El].

 language_westron_desc:0 "Вестрон, или адуни, - креолизованный адунаикский вариант языка Средиземья. Вестрон сформировался в северных колониях Нуменора, где адунаикский считался  [Concept( 'faithfulshort', 'Верными' )|E] запятнанным из-за ассоциации с [Concept( 'kingsmen', 'Людьми Короля' )|E].

Под влиянием дунэдайн вестрон стал известен как общий язык в землях Запада из-за своей популярности: гномы, орки и эльфы говорили на этом языке или на близком к нему диалекте."

 language_orcish_name:0 "Орочий"
 language_orcish_desc:0 "While Orcs do not have a unified language structure, they do indeed share the practice of composing their daily speech from corrupted borrowings from the languages of Middle-Earth, with Westron and Black Speech being the most common languages they borrow for the Orkish speech. The variations in Orkish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, as different tribes would adapt to the languages of the peoples that surrounded them. In particular, the western orcs often used Westron as their tongue between tribes on account of this."

 language_black_speech_desc:0 "Black Speech was created by the Dark Lord Sauron during the Second Age to be the common language of all his servants. Black Speech is seen as a dark and evil language by the wise of Middle Earth, and few dare to utter it, therefore, it is spoken by few outside Sauron's influence."

 language_taliska_name:0 "Талисканский"
 language_taliska_desc:0 "Taliska was the shared ancestral tongue of the Houses of Bëor and Hador. During their migration westward, the tongue was influenced by both the Avarin and the Dwarven Khuzdul. By the time the two tribes arrived to Beleriand, their tongues had diverged significantly, with Bëorian Taliska incorporating far more Elven elements than Hadoric Taliska.\n\nThe Bëorians largley abandoned their own branch of Taliska upon settling in Beleriand, adopting Sindarin. As a result, it would be Hadoric Taliska which would survive and evolve into the later tongue of [numenor|E], Adûnaic."

 language_adunaic_name:0 "Адунаический"
 language_adunaic_desc:0 "Adûnaic is the language spoken in the former Númenórean Colonies south of the Harnen, derived from Taliska, the language of the First Age Edain. The language evolved following the Akallabêth, with the now independent Realms in Exile accepting foreign influences in their dialect, such as Bellakar and Anarikê, or choosing to conservatively maintain the language, a practice taken by the Adûnai realms of Thâni-Hazad and Tantûrak.\n\nAdûnaic can be split into four different branches, Northern, Central, Southern and Eastern:\n\nNorthern Branch: Umbarean Adûnaic, the most similar to High Adûnaic of Númenor, yet also having Northern Apysaic influence.\n\nCentral Branch: Bellakari Adûnaic, further subdivided into Northern and Southern Dialect, with the former having more Tedjin influence and the latter having more Bôzishnarûd influence.\n\nSouthern Branch: Kharadûnaic, the language of the Realms of Thâni-Hazad and An-Balkûmagân, the most conservative of the dialects, yet also influenced by Southern Apysaic, it was also the dialect spoken in Tantûrak.\n\nEastern Branch: Anarikêan Dialect, spoken only the urban areas, one of the most influenced dialects of Adûnaic, having a strong Khyan influence."

 language_sindarin_desc:0 "Named after the [sindarelves|E] elves of [beleriand|E], Sindarin was the 'common tongue' of the Elves of the [westlands|E] of Middle-earth.\n\nRelated to the Telerin tongue of Valinor, Sindarin developed in Beleriand during the [yearofthetreesage|E]. After the return of the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to [middleearth|E], Elu Thingol, king of the Sindar, banned the usage of Quenya in his domains. While this proclamation had little practical power to bind the Noldor, the Elves of Beleriand were also slower to learn Quenya than the Noldor Sindarin. As a result, Quenya slowly fell out of use and became a language of lore, with Sindarin becoming the dominant elven tongue.\n\nThe establishment of [sindarelves|E] kingdoms in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lothlorien|E] caused the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Nandor Elves of Lórien to adopt Sindarin. The Sindarin of [greenwoodshort|E] integrated many Silvan elements, forming a unique dialect.\n\nThe Númenóreans of Andustar adopted Sindarin for their daily speech, being descendants of the Bëorians, who had abandoned their own native dialect of Taliska. This gave birth to the Númenórean Sindarin dialect, which survived in Gondor and Arnor following the Akallabêth."

 language_rhovanic_name:0 "Рованионский"
 language_rhovanic_desc:0 "The Rhovanic rose from the northern group of Taliska speaking Edain who remained in Greenwood the Great in Rhovanion instead of crossing the Misty Mountains, yet the Rhovanian tongues would also be influenced by the Baradhrim tribes that came from the East in the Second Age, such as the Igath. Rhovanian was recognised by the Kings of Gondor as similar to Westron, sharing Taliska as a common ancestor, and thus the Northmen of Rhovanion were recognised as Middle Men, friendly to Gondor. The Rhovanian tongues have also influenced the languages of many peoples of Rhovanion, such as the Longbeard Dwarves and the Ioriags."

The Rohirric language is derived from the Northmen tongues of Rhovanion and therefore it is classified as one of the Middle Men languages due to its similarity to Westron, sharing the common ancestor of Taliska. Over the recent years the language has influenced the tongues spoken in the lands surrounding the Isen river, with the Adornaen people speaking a mixture between Rohirric and Gwathuilach due to their connection to Rohan."

Little is known about the Avarin tongue, yet it is related to the other Elven tongues through the common ancestor of Primitive Quendian. When the Avari split, their language did so as well, with three major branches being formed; North, East and West.\n\nDue to its proximity to the Eldar of Greenwood, the West Avarin dialect shared some similarities with the languages of the Silvan elves, such as loanwords.\n\nThe Eastern Avarin dialect was the most spoken of the dialects, due to the majority of the Avarin migrating East with some of them  being the ones that migrated to the far south.\n\nThe Northern Avarin dialect is the most peculiar of the lot, having no intial consonant groups, it is considered the most isolated of the dialects, with some even doubting its existance."
