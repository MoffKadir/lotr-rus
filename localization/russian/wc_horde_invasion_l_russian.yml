 wc_horde_invasion.medivh.1000.desc:0 "My entire body trembles as I utter the final syllables of the incantation. The storm roars with intensified fury, as if the heavens themselves refuse what I am about to do.\n\nBefore me, the stones shift with a terrifying rumble as the Dark Portal rises, immense and menacing. Its dark energy pulses through the air, and a magical vortex swirls around its frame. There is no turning back now...\nI raise my arms, invoking the forces of the Nether, and with a deafening crash, the Portal opens, releasing a chilling mist. I can feel them, on the other side: the Orcs.\n\nMy duty fulfilled, I use the last of my energy to recall myself to Karazhan. I light a fire and collapse before the flames, letting out a weary sigh. That wretched warlock... He will undoubtedly betray us, but he will have to wait before we deem him worthy of our attention. The fate of Azeroth is sealed, and what I have done today will usher in an era of chaos and unprecedented destruction upon our world."

The sheer magnitude leaves me breathless—a taste of something beyond comprehension.\n\nBut what is happening?\n\nI peer outside and spot an aurora of fel energy—a towering glow piercing the sky, pointing to the source of the shockwave in the southeast. The air hums with lingering vibrations as if the world itself struggles to contain this force. Lesser beings likely haven’t sensed it, but spellcasters across the world surely have.\n\nAs the shockwave passes, a vision strikes me. A massive portal has been torn open—a gateway to a land drenched in Fel and Necrotic powers. The mark of the Burning Legion is clear. Could it truly be them?"
 wc_horde_invasion.good_magic.1000.desc:0 "My concentration is suddenly disturbed by a wave of fel magic with a purity and intensity I have never felt before. The magic around me vibrates, dissonant with the natural order of the planet. The air grows heavy, almost suffocating, saturated with this unknown energy. Instinctively, I harness my innate powers and immediately begin purifying myself and my surroundings from this insidious corruption.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nLooking to the distance, I spot a radiant aurora of fel magic—a towering glow piercing the sky, pointing toward the source of the shockwave, somewhere to the southeast of the planet. The air still vibrates, haunted by oppressive resonances as if the world itself struggles to contain this crushing force. Beings outside likely haven’t even sensed it, but this tremendous surge of power must have been felt by spellcasters across the world.\n\nI feel it deep within me: this is no mere magical imbalance. This is a sign of a greater evil to come."

My senses are overwhelmed by their cries, and I fall to my knees.\n\nWhat is happening ?\n\nI glance around, my heart pounding, and spot an aurora of demonic energy streaking across the sky, its glow radiating from somewhere in the southeast of the planet. The elements still tremble around me, vibrating in defiance as if they are trying to contain this force. This was no ordinary disturbance. I am certain that many around the world must have felt this demonic assault.\n\nThe spirits seem uneasy. They whisper that something terrible has happened to the planet."

The rain pours down relentlessly, even here, and the air feels stifling, as if some unseen weight is pressing down on the region.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nIn recent days, rumors have been spreading about green-skinned creatures attacking travelers and caravans. Not trolls, not goblins—something else. Survivors speak of massive silhouettes glimpsed through the rain, powerful forms with glowing red eyes. Caravans are raided, and many never return.\n\nNo one knows what they are. But with the storm and these ambushes, the Black Morass has become a place best avoided."

The [Glossary( ' war against the draenei ', 'WAR_DRAENEI_GLOSS' )] marked the beginning of my rise.

I am a leader respected and feared by my warriors. [guldan.GetFirstName] may have manipulated my popularity to elevate me to this rank, but what of it? It serves his ambitions as much as it serves mine. Draenor is finished, but it matters not. I will rule across galaxies if I must—not over a world too weak to endure the power of the demons.\n\nMy sons shall inherit this new world. A world the Horde will forge in its image."

[Glossary( 'My ex-master', 'NERZHUL_GLOSS' )] trusted such a being, and he lost everything for it, as did I. Kil’jaeden made me slaughter the draenei, [Glossary( 'shatter the elements', 'HAND_OF_GULDAN_GLOSS' )] of Draenor, and enslave the Horde, my masterpiece, with the [Glossary('Blood of Mannoroth', 'BLOOD_OF_MANNOROTH_GLOSS')].

We last few defenders have retreated to the abbey, our final sanctuary.\n\nThrough the barricaded doors, we hear the orcs' fury grow louder. They have uprooted one of the sacred [Glossary( 'Holyoak', 'HOLYOAK_GLOSS' )] trees from our gardens, transforming it into a tool of destruction. Each impact against the doors sends a wave of dread through our hearts. Our prayers for salvation are drowned out by the cacophony of battle - the orcs' battle cries, the splintering wood, the screams of the doomed.\n\nAs the doors begin to splinter and crack, the end nears. We brace ourselves, knowing that the flood of rage and steel is about to break through, and with it, the last light of $c_northshire$ will be extinguished."
 wc_horde_invasion.9000.desc:0 "As the defenses of $c_northshire$ and its surrounding lands fall, our warriors descend into a frenzy of destruction. The breakthrough has unleashed an orgy of violence; every building is pillaged, every human cut down in their tracks.\n\nThe final stand of the humans is at the abbey. As our warriors surround it, we uproot an ancient tree from the gardens to use as a battering ram.

 # Glossary
 #################################
 APOCALYPSE_RENILASH_GLOSS:0 "The Apocalypse, or Renilash in the ancient common tongue, prophesied by Mereldar, refers to the final conflict between the forces of good and evil. This event, seen as an ultimate judgment, will seal the world’s fate, bringing both destruction and renewal."
 WAR_DRAENEI_GLOSS:0 "The War against the Draenei was a catastrophic conflict instigated by Kil’jaeden and carried out by the orc clans under Ner’zhul’s guidance. Deceived into believing the draenei were enemies of their survival, the orcs waged a brutal campaign, massacring countless innocents. This war marked the beginning of the orcs' descent into corruption and the eventual shattering of Draenor."
 NERZHUL_GLOSS:0 "Ner'zhul, once the most revered shaman among the orcs and the mentor of Gul'dan, was a spiritual leader who guided his people with wisdom. Deceived by Kil'jaeden, he initiated a bloody war against the draenei, leading to a catastrophic massacre. Upon realizing the demonic betrayal, Ner'zhul sought to defy the Legion, only to be dethroned and replaced by Gul'dan, missing the Horde's grim descent into corruption. Now, Ner'zhul lives in exile, a shadow of his former self, left to dwell on the ashes of Draenor"
 HAND_OF_GULDAN_GLOSS:0 "The Hand of Gul'dan, formerly Mount Cyrukhar, is a colossal fel-tainted volcano in Draenor. Once dormant, Gul'dan gathered his loyal followers at its base for a demonstration of unparalleled power. Using the Cipher of Damnation, he struck down Cyrukh the Firelord, awakening the volcano and unleashing a demonic eruption that scorched the land. This act severed the orcs’ bond with the elemental spirits, leaving Draenor to wither and die. The Hand of Gul'dan now stands as a scar upon the world."
 BLOOD_OF_MANNOROTH_GLOSS:0 "The Blood of Mannoroth, a vile substance, is the very essence of the pit lord Mannoroth. When consumed, it grants immense strength and bloodlust but at a terrible cost: eternal servitude to the Burning Legion. It was this cursed blood that Gul'dan used to corrupt the orcs, marking the beginning of their descent into darkness."
 OGRE_BLACKROCK_WAR_GLOSS:0 "The Ogre War was a brutal conflict where the Blackrock Clan, led by Blackhand and his second-in-command Orgrim Doomhammer, faced annihilation at the hands of the ogres. Outnumbered, the orcs resorted to ambush tactics and sheer perseverance to overcome their foes. During the war, Orgrim, haunted by the Doomhammer’s dark prophecy, attempted to return it to the lava where it was forged. The elements, however, rejected his plea. With Blackhand’s support, Orgrim reclaimed the weapon and finally achieved total victory against the ogres."
 THRONE_OF_KILJAEDEN_GLOSS:0 "The Throne of Kil'Jaeden was once a sacred mountain of the Bonechewer Clan, located in the Hellfire Peninsula, formerly the Tanaan Jungle. Gul'dan renamed this site when he gathered all the orcish clans here for a dark ritual — drinking the blood of Mannoroth, sealing their pact with the Burning Legion, and forever altering the fate of the orcs."
 JUNGLE_OF_TANAAN_GLOSS:0 "Once a lush and untamed jungle, Tanaan was home to some of the fiercest orc clans. But, as Draenor fell into decline, it withered at an alarming and unexplained pace. Today, it is nothing more than a barren wasteland, now known as the Hellfire Peninsula."
 EYE_RITUAL_GLOSS:0 "When a new chieftain rises, every Bleeding Hollow lord must undergo the dark Eye Ritual. This rite demands they sacrifice one of their eyes in exchange for a prophetic vision of their own death. It is no trivial act: those who dare to perform the ritual emerge forever changed, freed from fear but haunted by the certainty of their fate."
 CHOGALL_FORMATION_GLOSS:0 "The arrogance and thirst for power of Cho and Gall led to their exile from Highmaul, their birthplace. When Gul’dan created the Shadow Council, he took Cho’gall under his wing, teaching him the demonic arts. Thus, Cho’gall became one of the first ogre mages bound to the Horde and a devoted servant of the Shadow Council."
 PALE_ORCS_GLOSS:0 "The pale orcs, Void-corrupted outcasts beneath Nagrand, worshipped the Void and its prophecy of the Hour of Twilight — when darkness consumes the cosmos. Once savage and uncontrollable, they embraced Cho’gall as the herald of their dark gods when he came to annihilate them. He returned to the Horde with these fanatics fully under his control."
 DARK_STAR_GLOSS:0 "The Dark Star, worshipped by the pale orcs as a divine omen, vanished after the assault on Karabor. Called down by their rituals, its shadow engulfed the temple in voidlight, breaking minds and corrupting the land. Its disappearance is seen as a prelude to the Hour of Twilight."
 HOLYOAK_GLOSS:0 "Holyoak is a rare type of wood originating from the Kingdom of Stormwind. It is known to have existed at some point during the First War and it was used primarily to build Stormwind's churches. This sacred wood must be carefully cut and therefore it had to be specially prepared at a human lumber mill before a church could be built."
