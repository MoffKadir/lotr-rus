 EVTTITLE_isolation_1:0 "Uldum Unveiled"
 EVTDESC_isolation_1:0 "In the southern wastes of Kalimdor, a major stir has occurred near Thistleshrub lands. The locals of Tanaris have recorded the appearance of a majestic, ornate gate leading to lands unknown.\n\nSome of the farraki elders have heard stories and rumours of a long-forgotten kingdom, populated by titan worshippers and filled to the brim with their artifacts, possibly even a weapon that is capable of raining destruction on a large scale, although no one was able to confirm that until now.\n\nNumerous explorers already storm the gate, hoping to study or perhaps even sell the artifacts to the highest bidder, while the locals remain wary of the outsiders disturbing the millennia-old status quo, especially with the qiraji temple city looming over the horizon.\n\nOne thing is certain - Uldum will never be the same again with the shroud gone."
 ISOLATION_1_OPT_A:0 "Now where's that superweapon that everyone's talking about?"
 ISOLATION_1_OPT_B:0 "We shall see what these outsiders bring to Uldum."
 ISOLATION_1_OPT_C:0 "Fortune and glory, here I come."

 EVTTITLE_isolation_2:0 "The Mists of Pandaria"
 EVTDESC_isolation_2_pandaria:0 "This morning, a messenger brought you astounding news. A number of lighthouse keepers have noticed strange boats coming out of the fog. One of the ships was wrecked, but the rest managed to find a way out of the mists.\n\nHow could these boats have found a way in and out of Pandaria's mists? Could it mean that the mists have parted?\n\nThe wrecked ship's crew is not like any other race we know. They speak about kingdoms and lands beyond the sea. If their stories are true, the world is much bigger and more dangerous than we believed. We must be prepared to face more ships and wanderers soon."
 EVTDESC_isolation_2_azeroth:0 "This morning, a messenger brought you astounding news. A group of boats fishing in the South Seas has stumbled upon an uncharted land. One of the ships was wrecked, but the rest managed to find a way out of the mists.\n\nAll ships were aware of the importance of avoiding those waters due to dense fog and old fables, but it looks like the mists have parted.\n\nThe fishermen even tell that they have seen towers of gold far on the horizon. If their stories are true, they could have discovered a new land inhabited by sentient beings directly south of the Maelstrom. We should send expeditions there to learn more."
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_A:0 "New lands to explore and conquer."
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_B:0 "Welcome, wanderers!"
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_C:0 "Send an expedition, I want to know more."

 EVTTITLE_isolation_3:0 "The Shield of Suramar" 
 EVTDESC_isolation_3_suramar:0 "The arcane barrier surrounding our ancient lands has been shattered. The mages of Suramar have confirmed that the shield is no more, and we are now vulnerable to the rest of Azeroth.\n\nFor thousands of years, we have been sealed in this bubble, believing the world outside to be a destroyed by the Sundering. Knowing now that life survives beyond our borders, we must learn the wonders of the world and share our knowledge with others.
 EVTDESC_isolation_3_azeroth:0 "A great disturbance has been felt across the world, as a surge of arcane power has been unearthed in the Broken Isles.\n\nThrough the word of surrounding rulers and courtiers, it is confirmed that the ancient elven civilization of [GetTitleByKey('k_suramar').GetName] has been revealed to the world. The shield that has protected the city for millennia has been shattered, and the city is now open to the world.\n\nThe elves of Suramar have been isolated for thousands of years, and now they are free to explore, or subject the world to their elven might."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_A:0 "Interesting..."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_B:0 "Our land is open to the world once again."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_C_NEIGHBOR:0 "Greet our neighbors."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_C_ELVEN:0 "I'll see to our elven brothers and sisters."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_D_NEIGHBOR:0 "Send a friendly letter to the elves of Suramar."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_D_ELVEN:0 "Send a friendly message to our kin."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_D_UNAVAILABLE:0 "You are no Elf, nor can you reach the Broken Isles."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_E_NEIGHBOR:0 "Warn the elves not to interfere with our affairs."
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_E_ELVEN:0 "Send a message to Suramar, but stay wary."

 ISOLATION_3_OPT_F_ELVEN:0 "Let those elves know of their deploreable nature!"
 ISOLATION_3_OPT_F_NEIGHBOR:0 "Tell the elves to stay away from us!"
