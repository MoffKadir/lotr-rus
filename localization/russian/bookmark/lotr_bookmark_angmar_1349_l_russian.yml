 bm_1349_angmar_desc:0 "#TOLKIENQUOTE: "It was in the beginning of the reign of Malvegil of Arthedain that evil came to Arnor. For at that time the realm of Angmar arose in the North beyond the Ettenmoors. Its lands lay on both sides of the Mountains, and there were gathered many evil men, and Orcs, and other fell creatures.#!\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER: - Eriador, Arnor, and the Heirs of Isildur#!\n\nArnor. The northern kingdom of the Dúnedain, long sundered and broken between competing claims, now stands on the brink, perhaps, of unity. Argeleb of Arthedain has ascended the throne, and claimed for himself the throne of all Arnor, citing the end of the line of Isildur in the kingdoms of Rhudaur and Cardolan. The Prince of Cardolan, friendly to Argeleb, is likely to acknowledge this claim. But the Hillmen of Rhudaur, led foremost by Hwaldar, will likely fiercly resist the restoration of Dúnedain suzerainity over them. \n\nAnd to the north, a new fell power has been rising. Orcs, fell men, and other dark creatures gather beneath the banner of one only known as the 'Witch-King'..."

Наследник Исильдура, его притязания на трон Арнора не вызывают сомнений, и Артэдайн остается самым могущественным из королевств-преемников Арнора, а второй по величине, Кардолан, дружелюбен к нему.\n\nНо гордыня и честолюбие Аргелеба все же могут стать причиной его падения, поскольку, сосредоточившись на восстановлении Арнора, он отвернулся от многочисленных внешних угроз..."

The throne fell to his cousins in the house of Caladir, one of the most ancient and powerful houses in Arnor. For his part, Tarmacil has proven himself an able administrator and diplomat, but has watched his north-eastern border with a wary eye.\n\nCardolan has been aligned with Arthedain ever since they supported King Tarcil during the [cardolan_succession_crisis|E], and Tarmacil has endeavored to continue the good relations with Fornost. The chaos of Rhudaur's fall to the Hillmen has made it abundantly clear that continued good relations with Arthedain remains of paramount importance, and soon Tarmacil will face a choice that will chart the future of Cardolan..."

Well, no longer!\n\nHwaldar Hillchief, aided by the King of the North, rose up against the impotent King Aldor of Rhudaur, and slew him on the steps of Cameth Brin, taking the seat of the ancient Dunedain citadel for his own. Now the Chief of Chiefs reigns supreme over much of Rhudaur, hunting down all the Dúnedain he can find, his eyes set on soon bringing down the last Dúnedain holdouts in the Angle.\n\nHwaldar is deep now in the counsels of Angmar, and should war come, he will relish the chance to bring the fight to the remaining Dúnedain of Arnor..."
