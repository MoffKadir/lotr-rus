 WCHEA_1001_DESC:0 "It has been three days since I have last gotten up from my bed. At first, I had thought the ailment afflicting me to be nothing more than a simple cold, but it soon turned out to be far from the truth.\n\nThe first day, my courtiers brought me some foul loaf of bread which I couldn’t finish due to its putrid taste. But slowly they stopped coming, the hushed whispers of this place replaced by what seemed to be guttural screams.\n\nThen came the necrosis, as parts of my skin started falling apart. Yet I did not fear for I felt nothing any longer but a longing for a distant melody, a soft whisper in the wind calling to me.\n\n“Rise, and serve your King,” it said. And so, I rose anew."
