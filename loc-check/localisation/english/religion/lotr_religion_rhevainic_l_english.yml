 rhevain_religion_desc:0 "The Rhevain are the [northmen|E] who have not fully absorbed the religious traditions and knowledge of the [dwarves|E], [elves|E], or [faithful|E]. They remain a more superstitous and simplistic culture, often believing in malevolent spirits and being wary of Elves, but are hardy and true."
 
  ### Leofring Fae Court###
 faith_fey_court:0 "Fey Court of Foldewyn"
 faith_fey_court_adj:0 "Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_desc:0 "Leofring veneration revolves around the king and queen of the Fey, Béma and [foldewyncharacter|E]. Béma ever has been a friend of mankind and taught the Leofrings to ride and gifted them their herds. He is kindly and quick to forgiveness, though often wandering and absent as well. While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight.\n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofring believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of mankind. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favour and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."

 faith_midde_court_desc:0 "While the majority of the Leofring faithful devote their spiritual energy to solely exalting one of the two fey courts, there are some who reject this dichotomy.\n\nInstead of seeing these Seelie and Unseelie as diametrically opposed, they view them both as inseperable reflections of human nature, both the dark and the light, one unable to exist without the presence of the other.\n\nAdherents to this worldview name themselves 'Midwalkers' and seek to tred a path of balance and compromise between the feuding tribes, with the great hope to one day see the Fey Queen and the Dark Fey reconciled and united into one 'Midde Court'."

 faith_withered_court_desc:0 "Once, the King of the Dark Fey ruled a court of twilight, rivalling that of his brother Béma. His reign was solitary but fair from his halls beneath the hills. But his power was not that of his brother, and he and his people withered, and his halls, once fair and green, because a desolation. The dark fey rose again in dread visage, spiteful towards the living that thrived while they withered. \n\nNow darkness comes forth from that hill, a choking malice upon all who would dare approach it. The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."
