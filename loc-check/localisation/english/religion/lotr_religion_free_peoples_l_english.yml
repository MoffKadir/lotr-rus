 hakimian_religion: "Hakîmian"
 hakimian_religion_adj: "Hakîmian"
 hakimian_religion_desc: "Since the ancient days, a long neglected creed is rumored to have endured in hushed whispers among the Men of Darkness in the South and East. It is rooted in the ancient Voice which once spoke to humanity at its dawn, which they then cast aside for the Great Man. This Voice they christened Hakîma, 'He Who Spoke', and they did not forget his judgement for their fall. Those few who remember this truth strive, in secret and often in failure, to repent and to live upright and noble lives. Perhaps one day they shall hear the Voice of Hakîma again."

 faith_hakimian: "Hakîmian"
 faith_hakimian_adj: "Hakîmian"
 faith_hakimian_adherent: "Hakîmian"
 faith_hakimian_adherent_plural: "Hakîmians"
 faith_hakimian_desc: "The Hakîmians are those Men of the South and East who most clearly preserved the truth of the dawn of Men - and of their fall. For while the Edain marched westward, gaining enlightenment and truth, those who recanted their sins but remained in the East were few. They were judged as fanatics by their fallen brethren, ones who denied the Gods and would destroy their temples. Persecuted viciously, they hid and were forgotten. Even the Wise, if they knew of them at all, deemed them a myth, a tale of consolation that not all of the East and South had fallen into the darkness of evil or ignorance.\n\nFew - so very few - of the Hakîmians endured, their trials immeasurable and their sufferings many. But their faith was their bulwark and their guiding star, even though all of their brethren deny them and label them fanatics. The Hakîmians still hold true to that hope, that one day the Voice will speak to them again."
