 dark_worship_desc:0 "The original, primordial faith which Morgoth kindled in the hearts of mankind in Hildorien, Dark Worship is characterized by equal parts awe and fear.\n\nAt its core, though, is a terrible dread of the consuming Darkness, Death, which only Morgoth could loose Men from, for he alone was mightier than it and its Lord.\n\nThe Dark Worship brooked no gods save the Dark Lord, with only the Void as an alternative to his reign."

 sauronic_religion_desc:0 "After [morgoth|E] was cast into the [void|E] at the end of the War of Wrath, [sauroncharacter|E] was the most powerful of his lieutants to escape the justice of the Valar. He first cast himself as the heir of Morgoth, and then as indeed a god of equal standing (if not greater) than Morgoth himself."

 lidless_eye_desc:0 "Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of [mordor|E] sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. An eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. A god upon [middleearth|E], all shall revere him: [sauroncharacter|E] the Great, Lord of the Earth! \n\nThe official state religion of Sauron's empire, the Cult of the Lidless Eye goes by many names, but all its variants revolve around submission and acknowledgement of the divine authority of Sauron, the Lord of the Earth. His sacraments are administered through [sorcerer|E]-priests trained in the Morgul-arts, and the high-priest is the Steward of Barad-dûr, the Mouth of Sauron."

 sons_of_sauron_desc:0 "The Age of Men is over. The time of [orcs|E] has come! \n\nThe [orcs|E] of [mordor|E], living under the power of [sauroncharacter|E], view all other [conceptraces|E] with hatred, desiring their lands and their riches for their own. The world should rightfully belong to orc-kind, since they are the strongest! The Shakhbúrzdâgi can be seen as a cruder, primitive extension of the Cult of the Lidless Eye, which Orcs tend to naturally revert to when left to their own devices."

 red_eye_cult_desc:0 "The gaze of the Great Eye is the fount of wisdom, the crucible of understanding, the book in which the secrets of the deep magics are hid! Lesser orcs shrivel and break beneath its burning light, but we comprehend it for the glory it is! We are unworthy of its gaze - but we might prove ourselves worthy. We must work harder, create ever greater magics, forge mightier weapons for the great plan of the Eye! \n\nThe Naukdshu-Fai (Red Eye Cult) is a fringe [orcish|E] group obsessed with [sorcery|E] and the 'blessing' of being pierced by the gaze of the Great Eye. For their maniacal ravings, they were eventually forced into the hills by their saner (by orc standards) kin. Formed by a particularly zealous Orc-shaman who had acquired small scraps of sorcery texts, they desire to prove their worth to [sauroncharacter|E], in the hope he will bless them and acknowledge their teachings."

 melkorite_adherent_plural:0 "Children of Mulkhêr"
 melkorite_desc:0 "[mulkhercharacter|E] created [conceptmankind|E] in His image, strong, beautiful, and immortal. Additionally, He crafted the world for them to inhabit. But the foul [avaloigods|E], jealous of [mulkhercharacter|E]'s works and his nobility, stole immortality from mankind. Slinking away to their fortress-land of the far west, they made the [eledaim|E] in their image as Mulkhêr had with mankind. Thus, did the Avalôi usurp the righteous place of mankind with their puppets, and in time this treachery cast down Mulkhêr himself, banishing him beyond the world. But the Great Lord shall come again, and the world's wrongs shall be righted, the false masters overthrown, and the dominion of Mankind shall come at last. \n\nThe worship of [morgothcharacter|E] was introduced to [numenor|E] through the treachery of [sauroncharacter|E], only becoming practiced there after the surrender and captivity of Sauron. Sauron became its High-Priest in the Great Temple of [armenelos|E], preaching his message of dark salvation to the fearful [numenoreans|E]. After the [akallabeth|E], the cult endured in some of the southern [adunaic|E] colonies of [middleearth|E] for a short while, with it all but dying out by the early [thirdage|E]."

 creed_of_man_desc:0 "In the darkest of corners of the old empire of Númenor, a tale is maintained. Mankind, in the dawn of the world, had been threatened by the Devourer, and saved only by the Lord of the Dark, who taught them out to subjugate it, and make it their servant. This Dark Lord was none other than He the Ârûwanâ ancestors named Mulkhêr. But though the Ârûwanâi had worshipped Him, they had failed. \n\n The Nunazhme taught that the Poganin (Heathens/Unworthy, the Númenóreans) were corrupters of Men, and that through their own hubris they had destroyed themselves. Though right to acknowledge the Lord of the Dark, they had been led astray by their craven fear of Death, the Fate of Men, to make war on the [valargods|E]. [sauroncharacter|E], the Nunazhme believed, had set this temptation before the Poganin to test their worthiness. They failed the test. \n\nNow though, the Advocates of the Zâur an-Anî preach, the world was changing again. Soon the climactic battle shall come, and the faithful shall prove their devotion to the Lord of the Dark, and raise anew his ruined temple."

 white_hand_cult_desc:0 "A new power is rising. The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. And it is [sarumancharacter|E] who shall order this new age to peace and prosperity. He alone who possesses the wisdom to order the world. \n\nThe Cult of the White Hand is a cult of personality which emphasizes the inability for regular rulers to properly order the lives of themselves or their people. They require a guide, and as greatest of the Wise, that role rightfully belongs to Saruman, mightiest of the [istariconcept|E].\n\nThe believers of the White Hand are a diverse mix of Uruk-Hai and [conceptracemen|E], who are united in their goal to bring all of [middleearth|E] under Saruman's dominion. They can be easily recognized through the often crudely painted Symbol of the White Hand on their shields and armor. The most devout and zealous have it tattooed permanently on their forehead, chest or back. \nThe exact beliefs held by Followers of the White Hand vary greatly among the peoples. Many only follow it pragmatically and see Saruman as a weak imitation of the true Dark Lord, but there are some who truly believe that the White Hand will bring salvation to all."

 way_of_strength_adj:0 "Pardahûnúk"
 way_of_strength_adherent:0 "Orc"
 way_of_strength_adherent_plural:0 "Orcs"
 way_of_strength_desc:0 "Rejecting service to the [darklord|E], the Pardahûnúk refers to the [orcs|E] who instead harbor desires to take that place themselves. Not really a religion, it is much more a very crude philosophy, born as much of spite and instinct as any sort of larger worldview. \n\nIn short, it is this - the weak shall serve the strong. There are no depths to which one cannot sink in the name of seizing power, of becoming one’s own lord and master. In time even the strongest stumble and their foes slay them; then a new orc shall take his place at the top of the peak, and the cycle begins anew. This is an eternal cycle, one which the Orcs shall perpetrate unto the ending of the world."

 cult_of_the_ulukai_desc:0 "When [gundabad|E] fell to the hosts of the [orcs|E], its leader bore the Ulûkai, a great black jewel, one of the greatest treasures of the treasury of [angband|E]. The jewel exuded an aura which echoed the throne room of Angband, and indeed the Dark Lord [morgothcharacter|E] himself, emitting a perverse light corrupted by the long years of his dominion. By right of bearing the jewel, Skorg, first lord of Gundabad, claimed the title of Ashdurbúk (Sole Ruler) of the North. For the Jewel called darkness to darkness, and strength to strength, and Skorg grew fell and strong by its grace, though ever more cruel, and the orcs feared and reveared him. To hold the Ulûkai is to be embraced by the Dark, to bear the blessing and curse of its Lord. When Skorg was entombed in the deepest depths of Gundabad, he took with him the Ulûkai, and those who seek to claim the mantle of Ashdurbúk must brave the darkened depths alone to bring it to the sun's light once more."

 dragon_cult_desc:0 "In the remote corners of the Grey Mountains, [orcs|E] over time came to worship the [dragons|E] that dwelled there out of fear and reverence for their strength. The beliefs held by these individual cults vary greatly due to their isolation, but some most have in common: Dragons are tyrants made of flesh and flame, destined to rule the world, and they will burn all who oppose them. The popularity of these cults waxed and waned greatly overtime, but with the decline and eventual extinction of the last Great Dragons in the late [thirdage|E], they have begun to loose popularity."
