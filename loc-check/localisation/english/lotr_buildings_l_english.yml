He disappears into his workshop for days on end and all we hear is banging, whimpering, sometimes sobbing. But occasionally he comes up with a contraption of especially crooked genius. \n\nOnce he didn’t come out for three weeks.

 building_hunting_outposts_03_desc:0 "Ghûl’s are nasty, hairless vermin that infest the fetid caves of Mordor. Orcs are the same, only hairy. Both eat the other given half a chance, but only orcs know how to build a storage pen."
 building_hunting_outposts_04:0 "Gristle Hut"
 building_hunting_outposts_04_desc:0 "This is where you store the most chewy, crunchy, fatty, barely-digestible bits of flesh. Hung, cured, and smoked. Most races wouldn’t touch it, but orcs consider it a delicacy worth its weight in gold. In sausage form it’s almost as effective as lembas, but less dusty."

 building_hunting_outposts_08:0 "Graug Cage"
 building_hunting_outposts_08_desc:0 "Graug’s are difficult beasts. Expensive to feed. Really bad temper. Basically untameable. But also unkillable.

 building_liquor_stills_02:0 "Stills"
 building_liquor_stills_02_desc:0 "As good brewing equipment is hard to produce, only the more skilled grog makers are given access to proper stills where fire water is made. Known to be a strong aphrodisiac, many an orc baby has the produce of these stills to thank for their existence."

 building_liquor_stills_03_desc:0 "Long halls lined with large copper boilers produce a steady supply of fine orcish liquor, drained off through a series of thin pipes ready to be stored in wooden barrels.

From the outside, it might not appear like much, but inside hides vast wealth plundered from lands far and wide."

# Proving Grounds
 building_type_proving_ground_01:0 "Proving Grounds"
 building_type_proving_ground_01_desc:0 "The dominance hierarchy is the bedrock of orc society, with an individual's worth and rank determined by their ability to overpower, intimidate or deceive their peers. The most public of these displays can be found at the Proving Grounds, where the greatest of commanders are born in the glory of blood and slaughter."
 building_proving_ground_01:0 "Fighting Pits"
 building_proving_ground_01_desc:0 "The shrill sound of iron on iron and the desperate begging for mercy of the defeated are a common in these fighting pits. It is here that grudges are settled, rivalries are born, and the greatest fighters rise from the ranks."
 building_proving_ground_02:0 "Arena"
 building_proving_ground_02_desc:0 "Well known warriors of the pits grow in renown and begin to become regular fixtures, drawing interested onlookers to see them settle their grudges."
 building_proving_ground_03:0 "Stands"
 building_proving_ground_03_desc:0 "Crude wooden stands allow growing crowds to watch as legends rise in the heat of the arena. Betting is commonplace among the rowdy rabble of onlookers and liquor fuelled brawls are as readily found in the stands as they are in the arena itself."

# Tunnel Network

 building_tunnel_network_02:0 "Sprawling Tunnels"
 building_tunnel_network_02_desc:0 "Time spent excavating the more commonly used pathways and increasing the structural supports of the ceiling allows for quicker movement of reinforcements, supplies and goods.

 building_tunnel_network_03:0 "Underground Labyrinth"
 building_tunnel_network_03_desc:0 "Over time, the constant expansion of these vast and extensive networks has formed a maze of irregular passages.

# Slaughterhouses
 building_type_slaughterhouses_01:0 "Slaughterhouses"
 building_type_slaughterhouses_01_desc:0 "The only thing greater than an orc's desire for blood and carnage is their insatiable hunger for flesh. These slaughterhouses process all manner of carcasses - whether man, elf or beast - to feed vast numbers of hungry mouths. Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!"
 building_slaughterhouses_01:0 "Abattoirs"
 building_slaughterhouses_01_desc:0 "Grizzly scenes of wanton slaughter are common in orcish abattoirs, second only to the sights of a battlefield after an Uruk raid. With flesh in such high demand, abattoir work is relentless and there is no patience for laziness or excuses. If an orc does not meet their quota, they're likely to be next on the block."
 building_slaughterhouses_02:0 "Butchers"
 building_slaughterhouses_02_desc:0 "After slaughter, the butchers get to work with skill and speed. Armed with heavy cleavers, they chop carcasses into portions of flesh, with the best cuts being set aside for orc war leaders. Butchers are often larger in stature than even some of the most fearsome Uruks, simply due to the healthy supply of meat consumed on the job."
 building_slaughterhouses_03:0 "Eateries"
 building_slaughterhouses_03_desc:0 "While not exactly offering haute cuisine, these eateries are always found buzzing with hungry orcs. The loud noises of gnashing teeth and tearing flesh travel almost as far as the wretched smell of the place.

 building_experimental_workshop_03_desc:0 "A few key Uruks have wrestled control of the weapons testing site, and they conduct experiments brutal and stomach-turning.

Some have speculated it was a house of one of the Gods before the ancient battle, in which mankind took refuge from the terrible fury of Vâtra. \n\nAt its heart is the Well of Iunást, now housed in a solidly-built shrine. Named after the Bozishnarud hero, it has never run dry, but supplies a never-ending source of water for the ancient citadel.

Over the centuries, in the waxing and waning of An-Balkumagan’s power, it has often fallen into the hands of the rebellious natives of Tulwang, or been captured by foreign powers seeking to check Anbalûkkhôri expansion.

In part this was because he was stuck in his ways, but he was also canny in his recognition that moving the seat of power to the heartland of any one tribe would be regarded as favouritism among the factious people of wood and vale.

Uniquely, they retain a memory of the early contact between the Woodmen and the Galadhrim, and this is most clearly expressed in the ancient settlement of Sairthiudabaurg. Influenced by the flets of Lothlorien, the Sairthiuda’s ancient home is entirely above ground. An ingenious network of concealed platforms linked by artful sky-bridges and rope walkways are held aloft by a combination of ingenious carpentry and the ancient trees of the forest itself, such that some Sairthiuda are said to never touch the ground, and to fear it. \n\nA source of enormous pride for the woodmen, and regarded as a deeply sacred place, Sairthiudabaurg is also difficult for any enemy to attack due to its skillful concealment and the constant threat of arrows and other projectiles raining down from above; many a raiding party has been slaughtered in the space of a breath without even realising that their futile march had reached the sky-city of the Sairthiuda."

The cruel cultists have been driven away, and their dread practices are now but a memory. \n\nThe groves have been replanted, and the ancient walls of the temple are now clad in flowering vines home to flitting butterflies and chirping birds. Where once echoed anguished cries, now the voices of the elves are raised again in mellifluous harmony, calling out thanks to Manwë in tongue older than the sun and moon."

 building_wonder_mistrand_01_desc:0 "Raised in the last days of the second age, the walls of Mistrand are known as the 'Goddess Shield', for they were raised and dedicated to one of the most prominent goddesses of the Easterling pantheon. High and wide, these walls are what have assured Mistrand's continued safety and prosperity through the long years, though they have fallen before. Behind the walls, Mistrand has been able to grow into the one true lasting, ancient metropole of Rhûn."
 building_wonder_mistrand_02:0 "University of Mistrand"
 building_wonder_mistrand_02_desc:0 "As a result of Mistrand's status as the greatest permanent city of Rhûn, scholars have since time uncounted come to dwell within it and make it their home. This has resulted in many schools of thought and learning being housed within the walls. But they were not formalized, nor standardized, and so this vast collection of wisdom sat underutilized. With proper investment, we have constructed a massive and sprawling university, sponsored and funded by our government, in which at last this knowledge has been collected and begins to be dissemenated throughout our realm."
 building_wonder_mistrand_03:0 "Jewel of the Inland Sea"
 building_wonder_mistrand_03_desc:0 "Though Mistrand has always stood above the other cities of Rhûn, now none can say it is not one of the greatest throughout the entire world. The great walls now are painted with vibrant and expensive dyes, the ways well-paved and safely guarded. The university attracts scholars from the East and West, and the markets are always thronging with distant merchants. We have long known Mistrand to be a gem - but now she shines as a radiant jewel, fine cut with much patience, an equal to any other."
