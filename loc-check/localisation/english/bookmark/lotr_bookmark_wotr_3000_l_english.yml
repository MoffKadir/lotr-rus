In 2463 T3A, the White Council was formed in response to the growing threat of Sauron’s return. He spent years in Minas Tirith, Gondor, studying in its libraries and examining its ancient archives before offering his service to the Steward of Minas Tirith as keeper of Isengard.\n\nIn secret, Saruman seeks the One Ring, and starts the new millennium with a choice before him."
 # NOTE Alternative text: "Saruman came to Middle-earth two thousand years ago as a servant of the Valar and sent alongside other Maiar known as the Istari. He has been growing in power and is now corrupted by ambition, jealousy and pride.\n\nResiding in Orthanc, Saruman has long searched for the One Ring as he hopes to make its power his own. And by communicating with Sauron through the palantír he has truly fallen into shadow. Now a servant of darkness, Saruman has bought the loyalty of King Théoden’s advisor Gríma, who he hopes shall help him weaken Rohan." - edited from Julius Caesar.
