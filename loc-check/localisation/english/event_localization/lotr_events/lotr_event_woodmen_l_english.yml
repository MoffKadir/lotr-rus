 ### Woodmen starting events ###

 woodmen.0100.t:0 "The Gudamari"
 woodmen.0100.desc:0 "The Gudumari were once the largest tribe among the Woodmen of Rhovanion, but their numbers have dwindled and many have merged into the Olphangings, lynchpin of Beorning power. \n\nTheir remaining villages are populated by those who refused to assimilate, and instead migrated north into the largely unpopulated eaves in the north-west of the forest near the Elfgate, and they retain their independence from the Beorning confederacy. \n\nCan the Olphangings retain their independence and reclaim their status as the paramount Woodmen tribe, or will they further diminish, and pass into memory?"
 woodmen.0100.a:0 "Trust to the trees!"
 woodmen.0100.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Gudamari is in your hands."

 woodmen.0101.t:0 "The Sairthidua"
 woodmen.0101.desc:0 "The Sairthiuda are the most ancient clan of the Woodmen of Rhovanion. Their legendary settlements of Sairthiudabaurg ("Woodland Hall") and Tarneburg are the oldest communities in Western Mirkwood. From the Galadhrim these men learned the fundamentals of forest agriculture, and they were the first to imitate the building of flets in the way of the Wood-elves. \n\nYet the Sairthiuda Ealdorman Diagero is elderly and his people are divided. Despite the renewed threat from Dol Guldur his sons and grandsons squabble among themselves, leading some of the more adventurous Sairthuida out of the eaves and into the Vale. Some have renounced their prized independence and sworn fealty to Grimbeorn. Others have fallen under the influence of corrupting whispers from the Hill of Sorcery, and have adopted heretical faiths. \n\nWill the Sairthiuda survive the coming crisis? Or will this ancient tribe finally vanish from history?"
 woodmen.0101.a:0 "The woods provide, the woodmen abide."
 woodmen.0101.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Sairthidua is in your hands."

 woodmen.0102.t:0 "The Fadirings"
 woodmen.0102.desc:0 "The Fadirings are the most archaic tribe of the Woodmen of Rhovanion, and now the only men to live in the deep forest of Mirkwood, in scattered clearings north of the Old Forest Road. They claim to be the true descendants of Faderda, the mythical archfather of the woodmen. \n\nIn recent decades, with the brief re-opening of the Old Forest Road, they had begun to undergo a minor revival, but now their villages are being put to the torch by the resurgent orcs of the Mountains of Mirkwood. A remnant cling on, for now..."
 woodmen.0102.a:0 "The sons of Faderda will survive!"
 woodmen.0102.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Fadirings is in your hands."

 woodmen.0103.t:0 "The Meroagings"
 woodmen.0103.desc:0 "The Meroagings are more warlike than other Woodmen, and once held a great swathe of the central forest as their territory, living a semi-nomadic life along the many Woodmen trails. As Mirkwood darkened and became less hospitable their numbers diminished, but they retain several settlements of rustic homes towards the eastern end of the forest, fenced with sharp wooden spikes, and often trade with the Dalemen. \n\nThey remember the plague and the terror of the Necromancer well, stalking the evil creatures of Southern Mirkwood whenever they stray into their territory. They hate the tribe of Corseching vehemently. \n\nAs the forest becomes ever darker, the Meroagings have begun to wonder whether they will only survive through conquest of neighbouring tribes, and the creation of a new, stronger realm in the eastern eaves."
 woodmen.0103.a:0 "We are the heart of the wood!"
 woodmen.0103.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Meroagings is in your hands."

 woodmen.0104.t:0 "The Waldandings"
 woodmen.0104.desc:0 "The Waldandings are among the principal Woodmen tribes of southeast Mirkwood, many of whom arrived as refugees from elsewhere in the forest and were united by the warrior-chieftain Waldan. Resettling the East Bight, from which many of their ancestors had originated centuries before, they carved out a small realm of their own. \n\nMore ecumenical than other Woodmen tribes, they long for the unification of their people on both sides of the forest, and are stirred by rumours of the rise of the Beornings in the east - could they be the saviours that they seek? \n\nYet any hope of unity is jeopardised by the malevolent Corsechings to the south and warlike Meroagings to the north. And worse still, word has reached the Waldandings that the Hill of Sorcery is once again sending its dark tendrils into the forest, seeking the downfall of the free tribes."
 woodmen.0104.a:0 "Under tree and leaf, life is brief..."
 woodmen.0104.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Waldandings is in your hands."

 woodmen.0105.t:0 "The Corsechings"
 woodmen.0105.desc:0 "The Corsechings are despised by the other Woodmen tribes, whether as a distant fable to scare children or a very real local threat. Making a living through banditry and raiding, they have increasingly fallen under the shadow of Dol Guldur, converting to its evil faith. \n\nEveryone is the hero of their own story of course, and the Corsechings regard themselves as the purest and most traditional of the tribes. After all, who else has preserved the ancient rites, such as stealing the babies of your enemies, or cooking their entrails in mead?\n\nThe rise of the Hill of Sorcery presents both opportunities and risks. Could the Corsechings become Khamûl’s most favoured client, and conquer a great realm in the forest and the wide lands beyond? Or will they be subjugated as a mere vassal of the Shadow? Time will tell..."
 woodmen.0105.a:0 "Beneath the tree, the blade..."
 woodmen.0105.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Corsechings is in your hands."
