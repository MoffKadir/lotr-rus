 ray.0100.desc:0 "Born of a Aûdrat Vâtra coup in the Bôzisha-Dâr, the Solar Dynasty has reigned in the Rây for over 800 years now. In that time, they have had their ups and downs, but have managed to maintain their grip on power by deftly playing factions internal and external against each other, leveraging their stranglehold on the overland east-west trade routes. \n\nBut in that long span, their fire of zeal has been tempered, and now are content to maintain the status-quo. This is exemplified in Vâtalinar, a cautious, elderly lord. In an hour of great change in Middle-earth, there are many who are displeased by this stance. \n\nAgainst those who would seek bounteous Rây for their own ends, within and without, can the Solar Dynasty survive as it has before?"

 ray.0101.t:0 "The Faithful of Tresti"
 ray.0101.desc:0 "For countless generations, through times and good and bad, the citadel of Tresti has endured, the ever bounteous Well of Iunast at its heart. And so too have their keepers, the house of Pârivaina. Despite tumult and change in who controls the Bôzisha-Dâr, the line has quietly but vigorously protected those who would keep the ancient faith. \n\nNow, the Solar Dynasty in the Bôzisha-Dâr sits uneasy, and instability mounts. In this hour, Dêlasîmor II watches, and waits, to decide how he should act going forward. His house has wisely held itself above the byzantine politics of the Dâr, and thusly are the last of the Houses of Regents to have survived since the long-ago coup. But, if the Solar Dynasty shows itself weak, perhaps a time shall come to restore the long-lapsed council..."

 ray.0102.t:0 "The Serpent Lord"
 ray.0102.desc:0 "The nephew of Suladân of Haruzan, Mardat desires but one thing - to seize the Dâr from the feeble and lethargic Solar Dynasty, and to spread his faith throughout all of Harad. \n\nIn the darkened corners of his reclusive court, messengers have approached him from the north, from Haruzan - and beyond - offering him aid for this great quest, so long as he swears to repay them in due course. Instead of a Solar Dynasty, might a Serpent Dynasty sit upon the throne of the Rây?"
