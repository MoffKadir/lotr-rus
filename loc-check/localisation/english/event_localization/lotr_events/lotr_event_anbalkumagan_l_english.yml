 anbalkumagan.0100.desc:0 "Once, An-Balkûmagân was a proud and mighty realm, greatest of the southwest colonies of Númenor, and then a mighty kingdom in its own right after Númenor's fall. But those days have long since passed, as the proud Anbalûkkhôri found themselves eclipsed by neighbouring Bellakar, and then drained by wars they could ill-afford to wage. \n\nAnd then, when it had begun to recover, the ancient Storm-King Khôrahil returned, seeking the submission of the kingdom Númenor had once ousted him from. The kings swallowed their pride and bent their necks, and thus An-Balkûmagân became the heart of the restored Thôn an-Khârlôkh, the Stormhost. \n\nBalâkhân, King of the Anbalûkkhôri, is in many ways a weak king. Raised under the regency of his mother, married to the sister of the current Storm-Marshall, while retaining the ancient rights and privileges befitting his status, he is expected to toe the line and fully support the Storm-Marshall - and thusly Khôrahil's - designs. \n\nOnly time will tell if he shall meekly follow, or if a differnet fate is in store for the proud Anbalûkkhôri..."

 anbalkumagan.0200.desc:0 "The Thôn an-Khârlôkh, also known as the Stormhost (on account of its master, Khôrahil the Ringwraith, once Storm-King of An-Balkûmagân), is a militarized realm with one purpose - to crush Khôrahil's foes. Though it was defeated for a time by the valiant league of Bellakar and the Rây, it has risen again in new guise now. \n\nThe Bellakar and Rây of today are not the ones of 1600. Bellakar is diminished from what it once was, and the Rây has abandoned its old alliance. \n\nSoon the heirs of Dulgu the Black, the feared general of the Stormhost's first iteration, shall fulfill what their ancestor could not - the complete destruction of Bellakar. They but await the command from their liege-lord in Mordor to begin the assault upon the defiant Tumakveh..."
