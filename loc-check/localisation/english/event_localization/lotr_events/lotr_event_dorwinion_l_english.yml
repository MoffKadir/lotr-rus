 dorwinion.0001.desc:0 "For years, two opposing political factions have dominated the political landscape of Dorwinion: the Winelords and the Master Merchants.\n\nThe Great Merchants were the first great lords of the realm, accumulating vast wealth through great trade routes sent East and West. These commercial giants now stand as the mercantile elites in Dorwinion's major cities, with strong connections abroad.\n\nThe Winelords, in contrast made their wealth through ownership of large tracts of fertile lands, reaping the blessings of Yavanna and producing the majority of Dorwinion's profitable exports."
