 dale.0100.t:0 "The Heirs of Bard"
 dale.0100.desc:0 "Re-established after the slaying of Smaug by Bard the Bowmen, the Kingdom of Dale stands as a rising power in the North. The friendship of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and Iron Hills have resulted in continuing stability and economic growth, and this has been accompanied by a population explosion among the Northmen not seen since the days of the lost Kingdom of Rhovanion. \n\nBain son of Bard now rules the kingdom of Dale, and his reign has seen the kingdom's continued rise. Prudent marriages have seen more Northmen brought into the realm and a stable alliance made with the realm of Dorwinion down the Celduin. His line stands secure in his son and grandson. \n\nNow, Dale stands strong and secure, its roads kept safe and its trade flourishing. While there is occasional friction with the Easterlings to the south, on the whole, Dale basks in peace and prosperity."
