 court_ongoing.2001.distant_opening: "I have made my way to the court in [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] in time for the festival at the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]. I secured an invitation, for I have to see [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 court_ongoing.2001.close_opening: "I am attending the festival not simply because I am the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] of the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], but because I want to see [target.GetTitledFirstName] there."
 court_ongoing.2001.desc: "\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] looks resplendent.

 court_ongoing.2003.a: "I had such a good evening!"

 court_ongoing.2004.dance: "[owner.GetSheHe|U] failed to take the hint that I was not interested in dancing, and after a few reluctant spins I had to ask [owner.GetHerHim] to let me go."

 court_ongoing.2005.story: "I asked the bard to sing all of [target.GetTitledFirstName]'s favourite stories, and as the evening went by we delighted in every tale that the halls of [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] have to offer. That Elf certainly has a taste for romance and adventure."

 court_ongoing.2005.a: "What an evening we had!"

 court_ongoing.2006.walk: "I thought it a pleasant walk, but perhaps it was too cold, or perhaps I spoke too much, for [target.GetSheHe] soon made [target.GetHerHis] excuses and returned to the dance, not even waiting to see if I was coming along.\n\nBy the time I made it back, [target.GetSheHe] was busy having fun with the other dancers."
 court_ongoing.2006.story: "Perhaps there was something wrong with the tales I had the bard sing for [target.GetTitledFirstName]? Even after [target.GetSheHe] had made [target.GetHerHis] excuses the stories never ended, as I listened to them alone."
