 destroy_bridges_leyawiin_decision_desc_vassal:0 "The Bridges of Leyawiin grant those who control the city the power to block any ship from passing from Topal Bay into Lake Rumare. If the banks of the Rumare are to truly flourish and prosper, the bridges must be destroyed - even if doing so risks tensions with the city’s rulers and residents."
 destroy_bridges_leyawiin_decision_desc_direct:0 "The Bridges of Leyawiin give us complete control over all ships attempting to cross from Topal Bay into Lake Rumare. While this dominance has certainly strengthened Leyawiin, it's also weakening Cyrodiil's economy and stirring up conflicts with our neighbors. It may ultimately be in our best interest to consider dismantling the bridges ourselves."

Once a vital place of worship, the number of pilgrims and monks has steadily dwindled, since the Riddle'Thar took Alkosh's place as the highest deity in the Khajiiti pantheon.\n\nPerhaps it is time to accept its fate and refrain from further investments, even if that means this sacred site will gradually wither away, unable to sustain itself on donations alone."
