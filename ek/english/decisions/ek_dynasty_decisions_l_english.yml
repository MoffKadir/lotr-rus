While the other branches continue to be referred to by names consisting of their place of rule, ours is increasingly just called House Camoran like it was in the old days.\n\nThe people of Valenwood now see me as a restorer of the old order, where Valenwood stood as one under a Camoran monarch, and I can only hope that neither Valenwood nor House Camoran ever falls again."
