 become_lich_decision:0 "Become a Lich"
 become_lich_decision_desc:0 "Every day, my flesh grows weaker and, every night, the dim glow of Arkay taunts me. No more! My understanding of unlife grows, and the chains that bind me to mortality can be eroded away by my will. I shall suspend my very soul in a liminal space where neither the dark waters of Oblivion nor the blinding light of Aetherius will be able to find it!\n\nI will have need of exotic matter from all across the Aurbis and plenty of sacrificial souls. This is fell work, and unless my faith accepts my aspirations, it will be that much more difficult."
 become_lich_decision_tooltip:0 "Undertake a religious ritual to transform into a lich."
 become_lich_decision_confirm:0 "I will not live. I will not die."

 become_necromancer_decision:0 "Become a Necromancer"
 become_necromancer_decision_desc:0 "There are things in this world that are, at large, considered to be unwise to partake in. Necromancy is one of such things. It is an ignoble science, it is the Darkest Art; this practice alone is enough to give Conjuration a stigma as a school of magic. Some of the worst people in Tamriel's history have been necromancers.\n\nThat being said... it is a science. It may not be a respected one, but it offers real solutions to practical problems and brings a new dimension to magical theory in the field of transplanar nymicomachy. Just how unethical can this be?"
 become_necromancer_decision_effect.desc:0 "Starts an event chain to obtain the necromancer trait."
 become_necromancer_decision_tooltip:0 "Try to take on the dark arts."
 become_necromancer_decision_confirm:0 "Let's delve into this path!"

 reveal_necromancy_decision:0 "Reveal Your Necromantic Powers"
 reveal_necromancy_decision_desc:0 "My true abilities have remained hidden for too long. I was forced to work in the shadows, lurking in the dark like an undead creature. However, this time has not been wasted. With each passing day, I grew stronger while unraveling more and more of the mysteries associated with life and death. Now, I am ready to show the world my true colors.\n\nBut rushing this decision would be unwise. Picking the right time is crucial here. I should be prepared to face any consequences that may result from this action."
 reveal_necromancy_decision_tooltip:0 "Show the people of Nirn what you are capable off."
 reveal_necromancy_decision_confirm:0 "They will fear me."

 study_cloning_decision:0 "Study Self-Replication"
 study_cloning_decision_desc:0 "The art of [self_replication|E] is one of the most obscure and mysterious magical endeavours. Mages usually seek more practical methods of increasing their own power, such as lengthening their time on Nirn by extending their own lifespan.\n\nAs a result, creating a [GetTrait('clone').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] of oneself is a very rare pursuit. The details of the procedure are shrouded in mystery, as there is little written research into the topic and every aspiring master would have to come up with most of it by themselves"
