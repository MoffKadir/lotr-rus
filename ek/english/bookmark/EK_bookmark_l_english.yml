 bm_interregnum_summerset_rilis_desc:0 "The House of Rilis is second only to the house of Auriel. Rilis XII descends from no less than eleven Rilis tracing back to Torinaan 'the First Kinlord'. \n\nOn the one hand he could annex his southern rivals, aggrandizing Auridoni prestige. Nevermind, the headways of adventurers in Seaside convincing him of how lucrative the Valenwood coastline can be. But opportunities are void if his worship of the God of Schemes precipitate his deposition.\n\n#bold Rilis XII is a mer cautious to the point of paranoia. Embrace the Aedra again or double down on the path of damnation? Unify Auridon or conquer into Valenwood? The choice is yours, if you can escape the Divine Prosecution that is!#!"

 bm_interregnum_summerset_elendarie_desc:0 "Kinlady Elendarie III 'the Sage' is fondly remembered in spite of her apraxic tendencies... Alas, Elendarie V 'the Bosmer' does not have the luxury of a pristine bloodline.\n\nHer brothers still scheme for the throne; The exile imposed on her own father for the same thing did not impress them. By overtly declared their claim, they have stretched her mercy thin. Elendarie 'the Bosmer' clinged to power with a now denounced truce. All pretenses of fraternal affection have been dropped as the children of Elendarie 'the Weak' gather their supporters.\n\n#bold A single moment of carelessness will spell doom. Will Elendarie be seen as shameful footnote in the history of the Aunoroe House, or can you defeat the naysayers and bring unprecedented honor to your dynastic name?#!"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_endaron:0 "Optimate Endaron"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_endaron_desc:0 "No one knows for certain who facilitated the Mothril couple's demise and thrust King's Haven into chaos. Endaron 'len Elpion only retained control of King's Haven despite his best diplomatic efforts, his cadets very eager to style themselves Kinlords. Goblin tribes seized Gralan, denying support from his suzerain Cloudrest in quashing the rebellion. Swift and decisive action is needed since each instant spent deliberating widens the rift between the factions and emboldens the Goblin-ken to push further. Endaron is a not even of age, plenty enough for skeptics to declare the extinction of the Mothril bloodline is nigh. \n\n #bold Endaron III will have to wage war to claim his birthright. Will he rise up to the occasion or get bogged down in inaction and passivity...Can you make sure the Mothril family is not swept down by the tides of change?#!"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_sanyon:0 "High Kinlord Sanyon II"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_sanyon_desc:0 "Sanyon II is the brother in-law of no less than the Aran-El! Late Sanyon I's agenda bore fruit when Lady Tuinden became Queen Consort. Lack of an heir apparent aside, it might as well be a done deal.\n\nHouse Aunsamiran has been loyal in both hard and easy times, a rare quality amongst powerful vassals. The current ruler of Dusk does not break the trend; he is much too embroiled in lust and duelling to notice the missives summoning him at court. Sanyon brazenly spurns Tuinden in spite of the love she commands from King Hidellith.\n\n#bold Sanyon threatens to undo everything his sire worked for. Can he pull himself together before it's too late...or will the Aunsamiran tear each other apart?#!"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_tragrim:0 "Kinlord Tragrim"
 bm_interregnum_summerset_tragrim_desc:0 "Tragrim takes after his realm, treading just above water. Only the timid Aresalmirmo monarch behaves as a petty Kinlord when his estates span the whole Iluvamir!\n\nHigh Kinlord Merandil never misses a chance to remind him during any and all social events. Even calian ceremonies cannot temper the distaste the two princes hold for each other! They nearly came to blows while officiating as sponsors of their distant cousin. Tragrim must carefully reconsider the humble act under the newest political climate. \n\n#bold High Kinlords are indeed treated with more care and respect. Skywatch should be humbled a bit with a good duel or war even! Yet does he really want to upset the status quo? That will be for you to decide!#!"

 bm_interregnum_summerset_zyg_desc:0 "Chieftain Zyg has led a glorious life, more glorious than anyone could have predicted.\n\nBorn in Southern Alinor, Zyg's insolent spirit led to exile from his own kinfolk, who feared total decimation from 'Gornas'. Tales of free Goblins in the Nir Mountains fueled his northward trek.\n\nCalcract's longhouses were slow to trust the outsider, until he protected the late Chieftain Morg from a murder attempt. Zyg purged the traitors, backed by the mortally wounded Chieftain. At the funeral he swore vengeance on the kinholds of Cloudrest...\n\n#bold Can Zyg fulfill his blood-oath to his patron? Or will his foolish promise spell doom for Calcract?#!"

 # Alliance War

 bm_alliancewar_desc:0 "When Mannimarco, the King of Worms, corrupted the Amulet of Kings just before Emperor Varen's coronation ritual several years ago, he guaranteed that the covenant sealed by Alessia and Akatosh would be broken, and Nirn would no longer be protected from a Daedric invasion. Mannimarco's master, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, seized the opportunity to initiate the Planemeld, using terrifying Dark Anchors to summon Daedric troops and drag Nirn into the realm of Coldharbour. But three political alliances — the Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant, and Aldmeri Dominion — stand against the Daedric Prince and his forces.\n\n#bold The armies of the three alliances converge, ready to fight to the last to preserve their freedom. Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.#!"
