The project's main purpose was to woo the emperor and stroke his ego, with functionality realistically coming in third, right behind embezzling the steady stream of funds coming out of the Imperial Treasury.\n\nBy itself, Lilmoth New City consists of ostentatious half-constructed quarters sprawling in strict geometric patterns that disregard the environment they were built in. Large chunks of the planning have sunk, or are sinking, into the irregular silty soil. The New City that is both built and habitable is left at the mercy of its own nightmarish logistics and constantly failing infrastructure.
