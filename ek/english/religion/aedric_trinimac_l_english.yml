However, although most Orsimer revere Malacath as the new form of Trinimac, a large number believe him to be an unrelated demon that has imprisoned their god, and that one day he will return to lead his followers into a new era. These devotees try to live a life in emulation of their chosen hero - focussed on honour, virtue, and unity of all Trinimac’s people."
