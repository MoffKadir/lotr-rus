 peryite_religion_desc:0 "A loose collection of faiths all revering Peryite, the Taskmaster. Overseeing the natural order, he is best known for being associated with plagues and diseases - some even claiming that the most devastating outbreaks in history are to be blamed on him. Despite this, and his depictions as a dragon, he is known as the weakiest among the [Glossary( 'Daedric Princes', 'DAEDRA_GLOSS' )]. His worship, while present throughout Tamriel, is not viewed as specially dangerous compared to some other Princes."

Most seek to honour their Prince by carrying untold numbers of diseases, including some specially created by the Taskmaster himself. Among their command is the spread of such illnesses throughout the world, going as far as letting corpses rot in the open."

 natural_order_desc:0 "The Natural Order is a foreboding creed, especially venerated by the noble-born and those who wield authority. To them, the pestilences dispatched by Peryite are instruments of purification, scouring their realms of the feeble and maintaining a perverse balance. They deem only themselves worthy of protection against the very scourge they take satisfaction in seeing others succumb to."
