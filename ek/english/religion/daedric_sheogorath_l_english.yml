Born out of the destruction of Jyggalag at the hand of the other [Glossary( 'Daedric Princes', 'DAEDRA_GLOSS' )], Sheogorath is the incarnation of what his previous form despised the most: Chaos, disorder, and madness. He might be reveled by the 'madmen' within the mortal plane, but almost everyone at least respects him out of fear. He holds a special place within the Khajiiti and Dunmeri pantheon, both times as an adversary or testing god."
