 golden_tones_desc:0 "The ancient Dwemer saw all things in the universe, including themselves, as made of musical tones. In particular, they recognized 'the fifteen-and-one golden tones', or 'avatheled kagr', as worthy of reverence. The great endeavor of High Craftlord Kagrenac was the manipulation of the 'tonal architecture' of the universe for the benefit of the Dwemer people. This culminated in his last and greatest project: the creation of the Brass God Anumidium, which the Dwemer were to use to transcend Mundus. It is a mystery whether they were successful; all that is known is that one day in 1E 668, the entire race disappeared without a trace, never to be seen again."
