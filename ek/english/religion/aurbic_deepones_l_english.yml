 brethren_desc:0 "The Brethren are a bizarre cult originating in the Cyrodilic town of Hackdirt, who worship a mysterious group of entities called ‘The Deep Ones’ that live in the caverns beneath the town. The most devoted members choose to live semi-permanently underground so that they can better hear the Deep Ones speak to them, and have been known to leave various offerings and sacrifices in hope of appeasing them. It would appear that they are led by a ‘Chief of the Deep Ones’, whose words and writings are typically transcribed in Daedric."
