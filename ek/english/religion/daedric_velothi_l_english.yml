This carefully negotiated synthesis of old and new teachings within the Cult has earned a peaceful coexistence with Temple doctrine, and between Daedric and worldly ancestors in daily life."

One day, they say, the Dreamer will awaken, heralding a cataclysm in Dark Elven society and unmasking the falsity of the living gods."
