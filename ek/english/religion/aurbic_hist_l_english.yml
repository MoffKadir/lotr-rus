 hist_desc:0 "The Hist are an ancient race of sentient trees native to Black Marsh, who created the Argonian people and live alongside them in a symbiotic relationship. Hist trees regulate the entire Argonian life cycle: dictating when their eggs hatch, what gender or form they take, and when they die reincarnates their soul into a new body - as well as providing advice and guidance to the tribes they watch over. In this way the Hist are not quite Gods to the Argonians, but more like revered teachers and loving parents, who each watch over an individual tribe or group of tribes. Alongside this the only significant deity recognised by modern Argonians is Raj-Sithis, who embodies the life-death cycle, and inevitable change."

 amberhist_desc:0 "When the Argonians’ ancient Sithis-worshipping society collapsed in the Duskfall, the sentient Hist trees of Black Marsh welcomed their children back with open arms. Not all agreed. A minority of Hist wish to guide their people back to the old way of life, but with Order as the new ideal in place of the Change and Destruction that Sithis embodies."

 ghostpeople_desc:0 "Some Hist trees believe that everything that ensures their own survival and that of their worshippers should be sanctioned. These tress are often found in the darkest places of Black Marsh where the sun rarely shines and giant leviathans roam. The Argonians following these Hist will steal eggs, corpses and even the souls of other tribes to strengthen their trees and bolster their own ranks."

 sunhist_desc:0 "The Vakkaleel venerate the sun as the ultimate force that bestows strength upon their Hist, nourishing it with its life-giving rays. Much like a tree striving to surpass everything around it, they are motivated by ambition and a thirst for greatness and dominance. However, in ancient times, they suffered betrayal at the hands of Sithis' followers, leading to their downfall. Many Vakkaleel vanished during this dark period, and those who survived are now practicing their faith in secrecy."

 lilmothiit_hist_desc:0 "The Living Law is a spiritual codex drawn up between the Hist trees and the ancient Lilmothiit with the help of Tseol, a wandering fox-god who gave them his shape. This agreement gave Litigants the right to live in Black Marsh safely, but forced its custodianship upon them in turn. The Living Law provides far too many obligations in comparison to the rights, so cheating and exploiting its loopholes is not only expected, but rewarded. Powerful Lawspeakers are known to "hold court" with the Hist via dangerous tonal magic seances in hopes to alter the terms of the contract favorably."
