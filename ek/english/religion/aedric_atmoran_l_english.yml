 nord_cult_desc:0 "The Nordic gods are forces of nature, with lofty whim and beyond accountability to men. The Nords' scant few temples double as family homes and feasting-halls; faith is no mere hobby to be confined to a single time and place.\n\nThe Nordic gods are in three groups. The Hearth Gods govern wild and tempestuous nature; the Testing Gods, Skyrim's endless bloody battlefields; and the Dead Gods, Sovngarde, the Nordic underworld. But the Nords are careful, and know that communing with the divine is a privilege; one best used in aid of the Nords' fight for survival in the harsh reaches of Skyrim, just as the Nords fight for survival by keeping their Dragon God Alduin asleep for as long as they can."

 dragon_cult_adherent_plural:0 "Dragon Cultists"
 dragon_cult_desc:0 "Dragon worship first appears among the Atmoran settlers of Skyrim in the Late [Glossary( 'Merethic Era', 'MERETHIC_GLOSS' )], who held The Dragon as the chief of their totemic animal pantheon. This eventually led to fervent worship of dragons themselves and especially their leader, Alduin the World-Eater, who was more than happy to renounce his world-ending duties and make their leaders the Dragon Priests rulers of his vast empire. Although the Dragon Cult proper was annihilated long ago, small pockets occasionally resurface throughout Skyrim, and rumours say that it may still live on as strong as ever in the northernmost reaches of the world..."
