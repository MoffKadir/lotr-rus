 auriel_adj:0 "Aedric"
 auriel_adherent:0 "Aedric Faithful"
 auriel_adherent_plural:0 "Aedric Faithful"
 auriel_desc:1 "The traditional pantheon of the Altmer of Summerset, this faith holds the God of Time Auri-El as King of all the other gods, and ancestor to all the Altmer. After becoming aware of Lorkhan's treachery, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the Trickster God, creating the first kingdoms of the Aldmer after his victory. The treachery of Lorkhan and their direct link with Auri-El makes this faith see existence on the mortal plane as a curse."

In the Falmeri religion, Auri-El's redemption was still extended to all elves who were pure of spirit, no matter how degraded they may otherwise be."

Thus began the endless religious war of ancient Cyrod against the Ehlnada Princes and mannish demons, still fought to this day with the bitter fervour of an exiled people."
