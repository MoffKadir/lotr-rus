 celestial_religion_desc:0 "The Magna-Ge, literally 'Star Orphans,' were those et'Ada who departed Nirn when it became clear that its creation would sap them of their power. Led by Magnus, they fled to Aetherius, tearing holes in the sky which we now know as the stars and the sun. All magic emanates forth from them, and thus their veneration is not unknown amongst mages and scholars."

 celestial_cult_desc:0 "The Nedic tribes of Hammerfell worshipped the Constellations, which they believed were able to manifest in the world to help them. Most important were the Celestials, astral beings who are personifications of the Constellations that travel across the sky. Although few Nedes remain today, recent archaeological and astronomical study has produced a revivalist group known as the Star-Gazers, who seek to rediscover ancient Nedic knowledge of the Constellations."

 scaled_court_desc:0 "The Scaled Court is an offshoot of Celestial cultists dedicated to the Celestial Serpent. The mysterious rituals of the Courtiers follow no set patterns, as they depend on the portents of their elusive master to achieve communion.\n\nRegents guide the faithful in his name, as the followers of the Serpent consider him their true ultimate liege. Delighted by subterfuge and drive, Courtiers are taught to bide their time and act when the time is right. Once the Celestial Serpent fully manifests his influence on Nirn, he brings blessings and calamity in equal measure. Worshippers and heathens alike should take heed of his advent."

 magna_ge_desc:0 "The Magna-Ge, or Star Orphans, were those among the et'Ada who joined the god Magnus in fleeing Mundus when the trickery of Lorkhan became apparent. Refusing to have any part in the continued existence of this prison-realm, the Magna-Ge are silent and distant deities, answering no prayers and granting no miracles. Still, this exact mystique and the fact that their cold, ambivalent light still showers Mundus in powerful gifts such as magicka, have attracted those who seek meaning and mysticism beyond the drama of the Aurbis, and indeed those who seek escape from the struggles of the Arena..."

 magnus_cult_desc:0 "Long ago the ancient Bretons readily took to the worship of Magnus, who was acknowledged with relative indifference by the Elves and Nedes alike, but whose domain of magic gave the nascent man-meri race a cultic niche of their own. Marginalized by the Direnni and the Alessians alike, this early Magnus cult faded into obscurity but never disappeared. In the deep woods and towering mountains of High Rock, druids who worship the Sun God persist - as do terrifying rumours of wickermen inside which captives are consecrated in a radiant blaze to thank Magnus for the world he created and continues to preserve."
