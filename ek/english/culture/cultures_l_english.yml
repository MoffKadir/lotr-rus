These deeply spiritual people held humility and ascetism in high regard, building chapels and monasteries to contemplate the pristine beauty of the land and perfect the silent arts of observation. Little else can be said conclusively about the ways of the enigmatic Snow Elves — the violent Atmoran migrations of the Late Merethic cut the reign of Falmeris short, and no settlement of theirs survives even as an archaeological site, all of them either destroyed by the Nords or lost to history.\n\nStill, travelers and adventurers spread superstitious rumors about these Mer, claiming that they hide from Nords to this day in secluded valleys and caves, and in cursed places where the weather tears the flesh of the earth asunder."

    falmer_betrayed_desc:1 "Misfortunate descendants of the Snow Elves who took the Dwemeri offer, the Betrayed — or Jorane in native Falmeris — are left to tend to the vacant cities of their former masters. The Dwarven poison together with the toil and crushing isolation of the caves altered their bodies into blind, slouched shapes and embittered their hearts. The Betrayed do not remember their past and do not strive to recover it: Falmer were weak and suffered for it greatly. Strength is a virtue, mercy is a vice, and such is the law of the world.\n\nBetrayed society bears no visible resemblance to their ancestor's. It is centered around brutal and efficient underground tribes in a bloody deadlock with one another for limited territory and resources. However, even though Elven aesthetics have been abandoned, its sophistication remains visible in intricate chitin armors, mushroom-farm terraces, and the whistling and clicking communal 'cavesongs' echoing for miles below the earth."

The war was bloody and hard fought with numerous champions falling on both sides, fostering an inextinguishable hatred between the belligerents. \n\n Nothing personified this conflict better than the rivalry of Umaril the Unfeathered and Pelinal Whitestrake. They eventually died in one final duel against each other but the Mer had already lost the upper hand. The Alessians moped up Ayleid remnants indiscriminately following the Rebellion (even allied abolitionist city-states), reducing the Ayleid presence in Cyrodiil to sporadic and unconfirmed sightings of “Wild Elves”."

They are Argonians assimilated into Imperial way of life in the confines of Blackwood swamps, where they toil as farmhands and laborers, blissfully oblivious to the Shunatei of their condition. Most have forgotten their native tongue — hence the name, Ojel, non-speaker — and the majority are Lukiul, unconnected to the Hist. However, even in such throes they manage to persevere and preserve their identity and their roots, which other Saxhleel find commendable and their overlords a headache."

Hapsleet tribes are relatively young, and have been exploited extensively by the Reman Empire for their greater tolerance of land-strider society and willingness to organize and co-operate. Their understanding of Black Marsh wildlife is astounding, and they seemingly know how to care for all manner of plants and beasts, including all the different things their parts can be made into."

Their skill with Alchemy and Enchanting is renowned and respected, which is necessary for their prosperity in Black Marsh, a naturally hostile and resource-poor corner of Tamriel. Lilmothiit society is evenly divided between sedentary city-dwellers and Walk-Worm trail-bound nomads with both groups helping the other not merely survive, but thrive in such harsh conditions."

Despite such spread, not even the Amz-Vtholften were distant enough to avoid suffering the same fate as their kin."

This power proved too great however, as the alliance collapsed into bitter civil war.

Short of ennoblement, there is no greater honour Imga commoners can aspire to. As an alternative to military service, some youths take to commerce or administration to further their station, honouring the legacy of their forefathers."
