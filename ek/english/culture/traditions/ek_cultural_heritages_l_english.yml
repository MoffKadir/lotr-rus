 heritage_aldmeri_collective_noun: "Aldmer"
 heritage_aldmeri_desc: "The tall and light-skinned High Elves hail from the Summerset Isles. Forever mourning their lost [Glossary( 'Aldmeris', 'ALDMERIS_GLOSS' )], they consider themselves direct descendants of the Gods who created this world and strive to honor them with their every action. This devotion to their ancestors has led them to develop a very constrained society, but one in which every Altmer is considered divine. Those not of their tribe, however, are less fortunate and are referred to as 'lesser races.'"

 heritage_ayleid_collective_noun:0 "Ayleids"
 heritage_ayleid_desc:0 "The Ayleids — also known as Saliache, Wild Elves, and Heartland High Elves — are, as their many names imply, a people with a storied history. They began as Aldmeri colonists of Ald-Cyrod and lived in a great multitude of vibrant and quarrelsome city-states, with each attempting to be as different from the rest as possible. What some scholars refer to as their gruesome Empire that Alessia overthrew, the Imperatum Saliache, was likely not a conventional state, but a web of allied Ayleid cities and their vassals.\n\nThey are world-weary sorcerers and artists, who once pursued limitless passions to cruel or bizarre ends, but now only long for a safe haven, and dream of their long-lost homes in the shadow of the White-Gold Tower."

 heritage_falmeri_desc:0 "The Falmer — or "Snow Elves" — are a group of pale-skinned Mer of Aldmeri descent indigenous to what is now Skyrim. Following the Sack of Saarthal and the infamous Return, the disunited Falmer were decimated, routed or enslaved by the Nordic settlers, leaving sparse testimonies of their civilisation. While thought extinct or at least forced into hiding, some sporadic accounts claim encounters with pallid Mer; yet the descriptions of these cattle-slaughtering ghosts greatly stretch the definition of an elf with superstition."

 heritage_dwemeri_collective_noun: "Dwemer"
 heritage_dwemeri_desc: "The Dwemer were reclusive subterranean elves found across Northern Tamriel, from Hammerfell to Morrowind. With no god worthy of their adoration, they instead perfected their mundane crafts and created the Animunculi for war and labour, constructs powered by steam and soul magic.

 heritage_bosmeri_desc: "The Bosmer are a race of Elven clan-folk of Valenwood, a forested province in southwestern Tamriel. In the [Glossary( 'Dawn Era', 'DAWN_ERA_GLOSS' )], Y'ffre shaped them out of the [Glossary('Ooze', 'OOZE_GLOSS')] in exchange for abiding by the Green Pact, a prescription that forbids harming any plant life within Valenwood and advocates a strictly carnivorous diet. Typical Bosmer are short, tanned Mer and may sport horns, flat pupils or eerie pitch black eyes. These expert bowmen coalesce in tight-knit clans, hardened by the trials of nature and internecine warfare."

 heritage_chimeri_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago during the [Glossary( 'Merethic Era', 'MERETHIC_GLOSS' )], a Mer named Veloth received a vision bidding him to go east along with all who would listen. Soon he gathered other dissidents from Summerset Isles, all eager to shun the mainstream Aedric pantheon of the Altmer and freely worship [Glossary( 'Daedra', 'DAEDRA_GLOSS' )].\n\nDuring this Exodus, the Velothi overcame many ordeals and proved their faith: even a God-King failed to prevent their migration! At last they reached their destination, the lands of [Glossary( 'Resdayn', 'RESDAYN_GLOSS' )]. Gradually they were taught prophecy, betrayal and intrigue by their patron gods, whom they dubbed the '[Glossary( 'Good Daedra', 'GOOD_DAEDRA_GLOSS' )]': Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. Under their guidance, they established a thriving civilization despite ruinous infighting and competitition with godless Dwemer and warlike Men for resources.\n\nThey became the Chimer, the Northern Folk."

They are commonly believed to be led by the god-king Orgnum, but far from all Maormer recognize his spiritual or temporal primacy. Indeed, many of those exiles had nothing to do with Orgnum's rebellion; the Aldmer lumped all their dissidents together and sent them off beyond the veil of mist in the south.\nToday, Pyandonea lives in flux, divided between the fane-dwelling Orgnumic mainlanders and the heterodox islanders who cling still to their baroque Aldmeri thought. Thus the home of the Maormer is never at peace: the islands clash against the mainland, and the mainland strives for Orgnum's fickle favor, for theirs is a reclusive master."

Once found all over Black Marsh, a series of catastrophes throughout history left but a remnant population on the edge of Murkwood. They lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle where migratory kinship groups and compact meritocratic cities coexist in delicate cooperation. A curious detail of Lilmothiit physiology is their apparent lack of gender dimorphism which is emphasized in their Lorkhanic myths."

Their traditional central position has left the Cyrodiilics open to the influences of most of the realms that neighbour Cyrodiil, especially from the Nords and Bretons. \n\nCyrodiilics take pride in their civilised manners and general competence in all pursuits, whether military, scholarly or administrative. Much of Tamriel's literature is produced by Imperial scholars (with some clear biases at times) which is a testament to their far ranging networks and advanced scholarly infrastructure.\n\nThe vastness of Cyrodiil has given origin to many local subcultures, of which the most known are the Colovians of the west and the Nibenese of the east."

In truth, the Imga appreciate nobility and courage, reputed to be common among wayfarers. This can be traced back to the Early [Glossary( 'First Era', 'FIRST_ERA_GLOSS' )], when many Imga leveraged the administrative vacuum to become itinerant governors or merchants under Camoran mandate.\n\nNewly enriched, some households trekked outside of their native Valenwood in search of further opportunities.
