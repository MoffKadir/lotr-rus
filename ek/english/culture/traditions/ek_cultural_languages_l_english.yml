 language_altmeris_name:0 "Altmeris"
 language_altmeris_desc:0 "The proud Altmer have a long history with their language, with it bequeathing both script and lexicon to “Tamrielic”. The Altmer are notorious grammar disciplinarians, teachers taking great care to drill into their students proper grammar, elocution and syntax. It is considered shameful to not be able to recite classics of Altmeri literature in the sanctioned way."
 
 language_atmoran_name:0 "Atmoran"
 language_atmoran_desc:0 "Men native to Atmora spoke their own language prior to the colonisation of Tamriel and the Dragon Wars. Nordic is different but ultimately descended from old Atmoran"
 
 language_ayleidoon_name:0 "Ayleidoon"
 language_ayleidoon_desc:0 "The Ayleids of old have long since fallen, but their language is well attested, and extant in their surviving communities. It had a strong influence on Cyrodilic and thus Tamriel's languages as a whole. Ayleidoon is close to Altmeris but has somewhat exotic features like using the suffix -che instead of -mer to refer to the Elven peoples."
 
 language_bosmeris_name:0 "Bosmeris"
 language_bosmeris_desc:0 "The Bosmeri vernacular originated in Valenwood, amongst the followers of the Green Pact. Many warring tribes and cities are nestled within the jungles but along with Bosmeris, the religious guidance of the Silvenar and the enduring political legacy of the Camoran clan form the cornerstones of their shared identity."
 
 language_bretic_name:0 "Bretic"
 language_bretic_desc:0 "Bretic is spoken all across High Rock. It has Nedic roots but the long years of the Hegemony imprinted a noticeable Altmeris superstratum on it. It includes the speakers' very own name, Breton coming from beratu - “half” -, the mixed-blood lower bureaucrats that kept the Hegemony's day-to-day operations running."
 
 language_chimeris_name:0 "Ald Chimeris"
 language_chimeris_desc:0 "Ald Chimeris was originally a specific dialect of Altmeris, but it gained status during the Velothi Exodus and went on to found its own language family. Chimeris is the closest one can get to the language of Veloth and the people he led during the Exodus. Chimeris is spoken by those left untouched by Azura's wrath at the Battle of Red Mountain."
 
 language_cyrodiilic_name:0 "Cyrodiilic"
 language_cyrodiilic_desc:0 "Cyrodilic is spoken in the Heart of Tamriel but also everywhere where Imperial influence once extended. As a mother tongue, however, it is only in Cyrodiil proper and some heavily imperialized cultures that you will find it. Ayleidoon and Nordic amongst others have all bestowed something upon this Nedic language, a testament to the Cyrodiils history of cultural exchange."
 
 language_daedric_name:0 "Daedric"
 language_daedric_desc:0 "#LORE [compendium_daedra]#! communicate, as all sapient beings do, and that transmundane and nymic force that they employ to do so is perceived by mortal beings as a language. Convoluted and esoteric as the Daedric language is, those mages, madmen and monastics that learn it can nevertheless only hint at the burning secrets contained in each word, metaphors reduced to mere incantations as they are made manifest in mortal diction."

 language_dovahzul_name:0 "Dovahzul"
 language_dovahzul_desc:0 "Dovahzul is the language of dragons, though so much more than mere language: it possesses a richness of description that imbues each argument expressed in it with cosmic truth. Shouted into the world by a soul as entitled to dominating it as a dragon, it can speak miracles and catastrophes into being, a phenomenon known as the "thu'um" and long ago mastered by the ancient Nords."
 
 language_dunmeris_name:0 "Dunmeris"
 language_dunmeris_desc:0 "High Velothi culture underwent a period of decline with urban settlement receding and the Chimer devolving into all out tribalism. The War of the First Council united them once more and following the Battle of Red Mountain, the Tribunal kept what is now the Dunmer together. This fostered a dialect continuum that has an acrolect for diplomacy, education, literature and trade, the so-called Dunmeris."
 
 language_dwemeris_name:0 "Dwemeris"
 language_dwemeris_desc:0 "The Deep Folk were highly literate and carved at length in their enigmatic tongue. It is said that proficient speakers can stir Tonal Magic"

 language_old_falmeris_name:0 "Ald Falmeris"
 language_old_falmeris_desc:0 "Ald Falmeris is as curious and elusive a language as the people that once spoke it, the long lost Snow Elves. Remaining inscriptions reveal a surprising resemblance to the Ayleidoon tongue, which is remarkable considering that little historical evidence connects the two Elven races. Stranger still, much of its vocabulary cannot be accounted for as either Ayleidoon or Aldmeri in origin."
 
 language_goblin_name:0 "Goblinspeak"
 language_goblin_desc:0 "The Goblins' language is an isolate, descending neither from the Merish language of the #LORE [compendium_dawn_era]#! nor the earliest Mannish languages. Because it is so different in such fundamental ways, the people of Tamriel have propagated the misconception that Goblins communicate in gibberish and overall convey no more than simple ideas. However, those who take the time to learn the Goblin-ken's language find that it is different, but by no means inferior or even more simple than other languages on Nirn."
 
 language_horsemen_name:0 "Horsemen"
 language_horsemen_desc:0 "The Horsemen speak a creole of Breton and Yoku"
 
 language_iron_orcish_name:0 "Iron Orcish"
 language_iron_orcish_desc:0 "The Iron Orcs have their own manner of Orcish, incomprehensible to those versed in stronghold Orcish. Along with their curious religion (for Orcs that is) it further sets apart this unique and mysterious culture. Speculation abounds on this dissimilarity in both speech and religion."

 language_imga_name:0 "Imugal"
 language_imga_desc:0 "Imugal is a remarkable isolate which uses vocalisations and sign language to expand the range of speech. Imugal Sign Language is a mutually agreed upon standard for Valenwood traders due to the ubiquity of Imga interpreters in large trade nodes.\n\nStill some claim that Imugal speakers withhold the most esoteric aspects of the tongue - to their benefit."
 
 language_jaegi_name:0 "Jaegi"
 language_jaegi_desc:0 "The Jaegi speak the ancestral language that the Tsaesci rejected. It could, in theory, be traced to its hypothetical ancestors back on Tamriel, but such an endeavor would surely kill a corpus of scholars."
 
 language_jel_name:0 "Jel"
 language_jel_name_desc:0 "Jel, the language spoken by the Saxhleel, defies classification and to many outsiders, comprehension. It is defined as much by what can be expressed in it as by that which is impossible to express, such as the fundamental concept of time, or things odious to the Argonians' ethics. Spoken Jel is usually embellished and modulated through body language, and can convey concepts so specific yet indistinct that translation into other languages is outright impossible."

 language_falmeris_name:0 "Falmeris"
 language_falmeris_desc:0 "Barely recognisable as descended from the Falmeris of old, the tongue of the Betrayed has developed two curious qualities: half the sounds produced in this language have a profound ability to echo, carrying words of warning far through tunnels and caverns underground; while the remainder are remarkably silent — mere whispers, audible only to a people whose senses are to the utmost sharpened by lack of sight."

 language_lilmothiit_name:0 "Lilmothiit"
 language_lilmothiit_desc:0 "Unique among languages in Tamriel, the Lilmothiit tongue makes no distinction between the sexes, but instead employs a number of other registers in its spoken form to address others according to their relative status, age, current location relative to their prowl, travelling experience, and so on. Most outsiders attempting to learn it have a hard time adjusting to this, and tend to use simple "standard" Lilmothiit that makes them sound boorish and a little naive, which some Lilmothiit, at least, find endearing."

 language_maormeris_name:0 "Maormeris"
 language_maormeris_desc:0 "The Aldmeris dialect of the Maormer, colloquially called Pyandoneaic at times. The tongue of the southern reavers is seldom known in Tamriel due to limited interaction."

 language_nedic_name:0 "Nedic"
 language_nedic_desc:0 "The ancient Nedes spoke innumerable dialects, some of which are close to languages spoken to this day while others are so different as to boggle the mind and complicate attempts at categorization. The prevalent belief is that the Nedic languages descend from the primordial Ehlnofex of the et'Ada, and that though the various Nedic dialects share a common ancestry with the Elven languages, they developed in metaphysical opposition to them."

 language_nedic_south_name:0 "South Nedic"
 language_nedic_south_desc:0 "The language of the Kothri and Horwalli has borrowed much from its neighbours, including Cyrod verbs, Dunmeri onomastics and phonemes native to Jel. Despite this generous borrowing, the South Nedic tongue remains recognisable as a Mannish language, and preserves ancient Nedic roots."

 language_nedic_west_name:0 "Western Nedic"
 language_nedic_west_desc:0 "The dominant tribe among Western Nedes were the Duraki, whose High Kingdom spread their language throughout most of the Deathlands. While the Duraki's many enemies characterized them as a savage and warlike people, most surviving texts are sophisticated heroic tales and astrological treatises, which both reveal a complex grammar and a great dedication to nuance in describing the stars and human virtues."

 language_nordic_name:0 "Nordic"
 language_nordic_desc:0 "Nordic is spoken all across Skyrim and in many communities with Nord roots. It descends from Atmoran but has seen intensifying Cyrodilic influence due to both foreign trade and education, and the effective hegemony of the Second Empire over the Nords in the last centuries. Draconic also influenced it during the heyday of the Dragon Cult."

 language_old_bretic_name:0 "Old Bretic"
 language_old_bretic_desc:0 "The tongue of the Bretons of old, clearly Nedic in origin, has minimal Elven influence and as a consequence bears a superficial resemblence to Reachtongue. Formerly written exclusively with a repertoire of Druidic ideograms, the language has under Bretic influence slowly adopted the Tamrielic alphabet."
 
 language_old_cyrod_name:0 "Ald Cyrod"
 language_old_cyrod_desc:0 "The Nedic tongue of Cyrodiil, spoken by its scattered tribes, resembles a linguistic patchwork of outside influences - Nedic, Ayleidoon, Nordic and otherwise. Ancient words of this language is still found in some local dialects and placenames in the Cyrodiilic hinterlands, though even the locals tend to be unaware of this connection."
 
 language_orma_name:0 "Orma"
 language_orma_desc:0 "The Orma language has long puzzled scholars, who have attempted to connect it to ancient riverine dialects of Nibenese, to the Ket-Keptu tongue, and even to a sacred language once spoken by the Rontha ruling class. It remains alien even in the alien Black Marsh, but its rules and sounds correspond to those of a Nedic language. Like their strange speakers, the Orma tongue remains isolated from their cousins."
 
 language_orcish_name:0 "Orcish"
 language_orcish_desc:0 "Orcish is perhaps the most misunderstood and scorned idiom in Tamriel. It is a specialist skill to know the tongue of the Orsimer due to prejudice (some likened it to “learning Centaurian or Giantish”) and their distrust. Thankfully, stronghold exiles with didactic leanings have contributed to disseminating the language and - hopefully - furthering the acceptance of their kin in Tamriel."
 
 language_quey_name:0 "Quey"
 language_quey_desc:0 "Lying halfway between Tamriel and Akavir, the thalassocratic Chimer of Cathnoquey understandably have their own vernacular. Just like its speakers went further away in their Exodus, Quey has strayed further yet from Aldmeris than either Chimeris or Dunmeris back in Dawn's Beauty."
 
 language_reachtongue_name:0 "Reachtongue"
 language_reachtongue_desc:0 "The fractious Reachfolk have their own parlances, despite constant warring, alliances, trade and intermarriage. Although there isn't any official standard, the Witchfolk are shrewd, and have grasped how to overcome dialectal differences on the fly. Generations of envoys have tacitly created a standard variant of Reachtongue."
 
 language_rontha_name:0 "Rontha"
 language_rontha_desc:0 "The Rontha language has a reputation for being chaotic, full of exceptions and irregularities, and appearing more like three languages pretending to be one than an organic whole. Despite this, the old Stonefalls Nedic language holds the eccentric honour of being the sole human tongue to have influenced Chimeris, accounting for the non-Daedric substrate that distinguishes it from the language of Summerset, mostly through martial loanwords."
 
 language_riektongue_name:0 "Riektongue"
 language_riektongue_desc:0 "Riektongue is the single other language on Tamriel related to that of the Goblins, though divergence a long time ago and the isolation of the Rieklings and Riekrs has made it so distinct as to make it unintelligible to other Goblins. Speakers of other languages find it just as unintelligible, in general."
 
 language_skaal_name:0 "Skaal"
 language_skaal_desc:0 "The insular Skaal have their own branch of Atmoran language known as Skaal or “Skaal Nordic”. Their isolation has left their tongue free of much continental influence and it is more conservative than Nordic, much like their religion."
 
 language_taagra_name:0 "Ta'agra"
 language_taagra_desc:0 "Khajiit means “sandwalker” in Ta'agra, a clear reference to the many dunes of Elsweyr. Ta'agra supposedly has no word for rules calling them “foolish concepts”. Still, the Khajiit have formed prosperous kingdoms, have a rich religious canon and established an Empire that stretched into Valenwood up to Arenthia. This means they are no strangers to law and organization."
 
 language_tsaesci_name:0 "Tsaesci"
 language_tsaesci_desc:0 "The defining feature of Tsaesci is its artificiality. All other languages emerged naturally, but Tsaesci has been created, and such deliberation can be noticed throughout its grammar and vocabulary. It is often described as a cross between poetry and mathematics, and an acquired fluency is always a source of prestige and personal pride. One of the most fascinating things about Tsaesci is total lack of influences, or even ancestry, from other languages; its linguistic sterility is kept via thorough, regular reforms."
 
 language_velothis_name:0 "Velothis"
 language_velothis_desc:0 "Following the ascension of the Tribunal, the nascent Low Velothi culture was split along sectarian lines that solidified into an ethnic divide. The hostile and hardened Velothi people kept the name and religion of their forefathers as they developed their culture. The Ashlanders and House Dunmer do not share the same language anymore."
 
 language_yoku_name:0 "Classical Yoku"
 language_yoku_desc:0 "'Classical Yoku' is a bit of a misnomer, Yoku having obviously evolved since the #LORE [compendium_first_era]#!. From the standpoint of the Redguards it is much closer to the ancient epics. It is common practice among the affluent—moreso Crowns— to have their heirs learn it. "

 language_tamrielic_yoku_name:0 "Tamrielic Yoku"
 language_tamrielic_yoku_desc:0 "The Yoku spoken in Hammerfell can be qualified as 'Tamrielic'. It has substantial influence from Cyrodilic as one can guess but also from Altmer and even Nedic sources but ultimately Yokudan in character. Forebears tend to fully embrace it whilst Crowns make a point of learning Classical Yoku #italic 'to keep the old ways alive'#!."
