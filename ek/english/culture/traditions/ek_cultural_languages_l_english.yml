 language_altmeris_name: "Altmeris"
 language_altmeris_desc: "The High Elven language is strictly controlled, said by its speakers to be the language of their godly ancestors. Its flowing script and extensive corpus lend it an air of elegance, but analysis of these works is almost forbidden: the High Elves have long resisted allegations that the divine tongue has changed throughout the ages."
 
 language_atmoran_name:0 "Atmoran"
 language_atmoran_desc:0 "Men native to Atmora spoke their own language prior to the colonisation of Tamriel and the Dragon Wars. Nordic is different but ultimately descended from old Atmoran"
 
 language_ayleidoon_name:0 "Ayleidoon"
 language_ayleidoon_desc:0 "The Ayleids of old have long since fallen, but their language is well attested, and extant in their surviving communities. It had a strong influence on Cyrodilic and thus Tamriel's languages as a whole. Ayleidoon is close to Altmeris but has somewhat exotic features like using the suffix -che instead of -mer to refer to the Elven peoples."
 
 language_bosmeris_name:0 "Bosmeris"
 language_bosmeris_desc:0 "The Bosmeri vernacular originated in Valenwood, amongst the followers of the Green Pact. Many warring tribes and cities are nestled within the jungles but along with Bosmeris, the religious guidance of the Silvenar and the enduring political legacy of the Camoran clan form the cornerstones of their shared identity."
 
 language_bretic_name:0 "Bretic"
 language_bretic_desc:0 "Bretic is spoken all across High Rock. It has Nedic roots but the long years of the Hegemony imprinted a noticeable Altmeris superstratum on it. It includes the speakers' very own name, Breton coming from beratu - “half” -, the mixed-blood lower bureaucrats that kept the Hegemony's day-to-day operations running."
 
 language_chimeris_name: "Chimeris"
 language_chimeris_desc: "Chimeris, an ancient tongue closely related to other Elven dialects, was spoken by the earliest Velothi exiles. Time changed, and eventually splintered it; but its echoes may today be heard in all Dunmeri speech. Only a few peoples still claim the name of Chimeris, bound in isolation to a form which has changed so gradually that few distinguish it from its ancestors."
 
 language_cyrodiilic_name:0 "Cyrodiilic"
 language_cyrodiilic_desc:0 "Cyrodilic is spoken in the Heart of Tamriel but also everywhere where Imperial influence once extended. As a mother tongue, however, it is only in Cyrodiil proper and some heavily imperialized cultures that you will find it. Ayleidoon and Nordic amongst others have all bestowed something upon this Nedic language, a testament to the Cyrodiils history of cultural exchange."
 
 language_daedric_name:0 "Daedric"
 language_daedric_desc:0 "[Glossary( 'Daedra', 'DAEDRA_GLOSS' )] communicate, as all sapient beings do, and that transmundane and nymic force that they employ to do so is perceived by mortal beings as a language. Convoluted and esoteric as the Daedric language is, those mages, madmen and monastics that learn it can nevertheless only hint at the burning secrets contained in each word, metaphors reduced to mere incantations as they are made manifest in mortal diction."

 language_dovahzul_name:0 "Dovahzul"
 language_dovahzul_desc:0 "Dovahzul is the language of dragons, though so much more than mere language: it possesses a richness of description that imbues each argument expressed in it with cosmic truth. Shouted into the world by a soul as entitled to dominating it as a dragon, it can speak miracles and catastrophes into being, a phenomenon known as the "thu'um" and long ago mastered by the ancient Nords."
 
 language_dunmeris_name: "Dunmeris"
 language_dunmeris_desc: "Dunmeris is the name given to the various Dark Elven dialects. Isolation and competition have created many distinctive variations, but the vast Temple bureaucracy and interactions between the Houses ensure their intelligibility through a prestigious literary culture. Its texts are written in Daedric script, a final gift from the ancient Chimeri patrons."
 
 language_dwemeris_name:0 "Dwemeris"
 language_dwemeris_desc:0 "[GetPlayer.Custom('GetDwemerisLanguageDesc')]"
 language_dwemeris_desc_extinct:0 "The language of the Dwemer is today mysterious, its spoken form vanished entirely. Dwarven runes, however, yet survive, carved into stone and metal, or enscribed upon failing parchment; but they defy transliteration into other scripts, and remain as secretive as they were when in use. What Dwemer texts can now be read are those written in other Elven tongues, for mysteries their authors deemed beneath their misinterpretation."
 language_dwemeris_desc_not_extinct:0 "The language of the Dwemer has returned. Its words are heard again, but misinterpreted even by their speakers. Those Dwarven runes which of old survive now grow and multiply, but still they defy transliteration, and they are now more mysterious than they were when they were only signs. It seems, with the Dwarves returned, that one can make of their language only what one will."

 language_old_falmeris_name:0 "Ald Falmeris"
 language_old_falmeris_desc:0 "Ald Falmeris is as curious and elusive a language as the people that once spoke it, the long lost Snow Elves. Remaining inscriptions reveal a surprising resemblance to the Ayleidoon tongue, which is remarkable considering that little historical evidence connects the two Elven races. Stranger still, much of its vocabulary cannot be accounted for as either Ayleidoon or Aldmeri in origin."
 
 language_goblin_name:0 "Goblinspeak"
 language_goblin_desc:0 "The Goblins' language is an isolate, descending neither from the Merish language of the [Glossary( 'Dawn Era', 'DAWN_ERA_GLOSS' )] nor the earliest Mannish languages. Because it is so different in such fundamental ways, the people of Tamriel have propagated the misconception that Goblins communicate in gibberish and overall convey no more than simple ideas. However, those who take the time to learn the Goblin-ken's language find that it is different, but by no means inferior or even more simple than other languages on Nirn."
 
 language_iron_orcish_name: "Iron Orcish"
 language_iron_orcish_desc: "The Iron Orcish tongue is like its speakers, confronting and averse to outsiders. It shares few, if any, words with other languages; even other orcs struggle with iron speech. Its very writing is stubborn, carved into metal and stone, enduring and defiant."

 language_imga_name:0 "Imugal"
 language_imga_desc:0 "Imugal is a remarkable isolate which uses vocalisations and sign language to expand the range of speech. Imugal Sign Language is a mutually agreed upon standard for Valenwood traders due to the ubiquity of Imga interpreters in large trade nodes.\n\nStill some claim that Imugal speakers withhold the most esoteric aspects of the tongue - to their benefit."
 
 language_jaegi_name:0 "Jaegi"
 language_jaegi_desc:0 "The Jaegi speak the ancestral language that the Tsaesci rejected. It could, in theory, be traced to its hypothetical ancestors back on Tamriel, but such an endeavor would surely kill a corpus of scholars."
 
 language_jel_name:0 "Jel"
 language_jel_desc:0 "Jel, the language spoken by the Saxhleel, defies classification and to many outsiders, comprehension. It is defined as much by what can be expressed in it as by that which is impossible to express, such as the fundamental concept of time, or things odious to the Argonians' ethics. Spoken Jel is usually embellished and modulated through body language, and can convey concepts so specific yet indistinct that translation into other languages is outright impossible."

 language_falmeris_name:0 "Falmeris"
 language_falmeris_desc:0 "Barely recognisable as descended from the Falmeris of old, the tongue of the Betrayed has developed two curious qualities: half the sounds produced in this language have a profound ability to echo, carrying words of warning far through tunnels and caverns underground; while the remainder are remarkably silent — mere whispers, audible only to a people whose senses are to the utmost sharpened by lack of sight."

 language_lilmothiit_name:0 "Lilmothiit"
 language_lilmothiit_desc:0 "Unique among languages in Tamriel, the Lilmothiit tongue makes no distinction between the sexes, but instead employs a number of other registers in its spoken form to address others according to their relative status, age, current location relative to their prowl, travelling experience, and so on. Most outsiders attempting to learn it have a hard time adjusting to this, and tend to use simple "standard" Lilmothiit that makes them sound boorish and a little naive, which some Lilmothiit, at least, find endearing."

 language_maormeris_name:0 "Maormeris"
 language_maormeris_desc:0 "The Aldmeris dialect of the Maormer, colloquially called Pyandoneaic at times. The tongue of the southern reavers is seldom known in Tamriel due to limited interaction."

 language_kothri_name:0 "Kothri"
 language_kothri_desc:0 "The language of the Kothringi and Horwalli has borrowed much from its neighbours, including Cyrod verbs, Dunmeri onomastics and phonemes native to Jel. Despite this generous borrowing, this tongue remains recognisable as a Mannish language, and preserves ancient Nedic roots."

 language_nedic_west_name:0 "Duraki"
 language_nedic_west_desc:0 "The dominant tribe among Western Nedes were the Duraki, whose High Kingdom spread their language throughout most of the Deathlands. While the Duraki's many enemies characterized them as a savage and warlike people, most surviving texts are sophisticated heroic tales and astrological treatises, which both reveal a complex grammar and a great dedication to nuance in describing the stars and human virtues."

 language_nordic_name:0 "Nordic"
 language_nordic_desc:0 "Nordic is spoken all across Skyrim and in many communities with Nord roots. It descends from Atmoran but has seen intensifying Cyrodilic influence due to both foreign trade and education, and the effective hegemony of the Second Empire over the Nords in the last centuries. Draconic also influenced it during the heyday of the Dragon Cult."

 language_old_bretic_name:0 "Old Bretic"
 language_old_bretic_desc:0 "The tongue of the Bretons of old, clearly Nedic in origin, has minimal Elven influence and as a consequence bears a superficial resemblence to Reachtongue. Formerly written exclusively with a repertoire of Druidic ideograms, the language has under Bretic influence slowly adopted the Tamrielic alphabet."
 
 language_old_cyrod_name:0 "Ald Cyrod"
 language_old_cyrod_desc:0 "The Nedic tongue of Cyrodiil, spoken by its scattered tribes, resembles a linguistic patchwork of outside influences - Nedic, Ayleidoon, Nordic and otherwise. Ancient words of this language is still found in some local dialects and placenames in the Cyrodiilic hinterlands, though even the locals tend to be unaware of this connection."
 
 language_orma_name:0 "Orma"
 language_orma_desc:0 "The Orma language has long puzzled scholars, who have attempted to connect it to ancient riverine dialects of Nibenese, to the Ket-Keptu tongue, and even to a sacred language once spoken by the Rontha ruling class. It remains alien even in the alien Black Marsh, but its rules and sounds correspond to those of a Nedic language. Like their strange speakers, the Orma tongue remains isolated from their cousins."
 
 language_orcish_name: "Orcish"
 language_orcish_desc: "The Orcish tongue is described as harsh and guttural, derided by many as mere mumbling and gibbering. But in the Strongholds, the language thrives; and when the orcs join together in larger groups, they continue their ancient literary culture, writing their orcish glyphs on tablets to be buried in their sacred cemeteries and houses of worship."
 
 language_quey_name:0 "Quey"
 language_quey_desc:0 "Lying halfway between Tamriel and Akavir, the thalassocratic Chimer of Cathnoquey understandably have their own vernacular. Just like its speakers went further away in their Exodus, Quey has strayed further yet from Aldmeris than either Chimeris or Dunmeris back in Dawn's Beauty."
 
 language_reachtongue_name:0 "Reachtongue"
 language_reachtongue_desc:0 "The fractious Reachfolk have their own parlances, despite constant warring, alliances, trade and intermarriage. Although there isn't any official standard, the Witchfolk are shrewd, and have grasped how to overcome dialectal differences on the fly. Generations of envoys have tacitly created a standard variant of Reachtongue."
 
 language_rontha_name: "Rontha"
 language_rontha_desc: "The Nedic language of the Rontha has long been lost, if ever it existed. Nothing survives of what the Nords and Elves of old describe as unintelligible speech by the easternmost Nedes."
 
 language_riektongue_name:0 "Riektongue"
 language_riektongue_desc:0 "Riektongue is the single other language on Tamriel related to that of the Goblins, though divergence a long time ago and the isolation of the Rieklings and Riekrs has made it so distinct as to make it unintelligible to other Goblins. Speakers of other languages find it just as unintelligible, in general."
 
 language_skaal_name:0 "Skaal"
 language_skaal_desc:0 "The insular Skaal have their own branch of Atmoran language known as Skaal or “Skaal Nordic”. Their isolation has left their tongue free of much continental influence and it is more conservative than Nordic, much like their religion."
 
 language_taagra_name:0 "Ta'agra"
 language_taagra_desc:0 "Khajiit means “sandwalker” in Ta'agra, a clear reference to the many dunes of Elsweyr. Ta'agra supposedly has no word for rules calling them “foolish concepts”. Still, the Khajiit have formed prosperous kingdoms, have a rich religious canon and established an Empire that stretched into Valenwood up to Arenthia. This means they are no strangers to law and organization."
 
 language_tsaesci_name:0 "Tsaesci"
 language_tsaesci_desc:0 "The defining feature of Tsaesci is its artificiality. All other languages emerged naturally, but Tsaesci has been created, and such deliberation can be noticed throughout its grammar and vocabulary. It is often described as a cross between poetry and mathematics, and an acquired fluency is always a source of prestige and personal pride. One of the most fascinating things about Tsaesci is total lack of influences, or even ancestry, from other languages; its linguistic sterility is kept via thorough, regular reforms."
 
 language_velothis_name: "Velothis"
 language_velothis_desc: "'Velothis' describes the countless Ashlander tongues, more and less intelligible with each other. Rare contact between the tribes, and even more rarely with urban Dark Elves, keeps these dialects within the same milieu. They have long since diverged from each other, and their ancestors; but many preserve ancient features, and to some carry an archaic air."
 
 language_yoku_name:0 "Yoku"
 language_yoku_desc:0 "Yoku, while having evolved since the [Glossary( 'First Era', 'FIRST_ERA_GLOSS' )], still remains the language closest to that commonly used before the destruction of Yokuda. It is primarily spoken in Yokuda but is not absent in Hammerfell; isolationist and conservative Alik'r nomads still speak a tongue so remarkably similar to their ancestors to be mutually intelligible."

 language_tamrielic_yoku_name:0 "Tamrielic Yoku"
 language_tamrielic_yoku_desc:0 "Separated by ocean, the language of the Hammerfell Redguards rapidly diverged from its Yoku parent. The [Glossary( 'Ra Gada', 'RAGADA_GLOSS' )] swiftly swept over the native Nedes, but not before picking up much of their language. Later, the needs of trade and diplomacy with neighboring Bretons, Cyrodiils, and High Elves made their noticeable marks. Today their speech is clearly Yoku in origin, but also distinctly Tamrielic."
