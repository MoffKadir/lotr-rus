The other Daedra, who take many different shapes like Dremora, Atronachs or Skamps, most often serve the Princes.\n\nWorshipping the Daedric Princes and bargaining with Daedra in general is often considered illegal in many parts of Tamriel, so these practices are often carried out in secret. Some races, such as the Reachfolk, Orcs, and Dunmer, openly worship the Daedra, which has earned them the suspicion of others. Meanwhile the Khajiit do not distinguish between Aedra and Daedra at all.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

This art was supposedly codified by Asliel Direnni, but most people in Tamriel already knew how boiling a plant could cure a fever, or what bones should one crush to produce a potent poison.\n\nAlchemical ingredients come in very various forms, such as plants or leaves, animal parts, undead remnants, and even Daedric summons. This makes alchemy a potentially very lucrative and very dangerous trade, as the most expensive ingredients produce the most powerful poisons and potions, but are also hidden in the most deadly places.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Opinions diverge whereas the existence of mortal life is a blessing — a position held by most beliefs sympathetic or neutral towards him — or a curse — the stance of most faiths that actively see Mundus as a barrier to immortality and a fall from grace.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

The elves were his second creation, instructed to tell stories — but forbidden to change the form of neither themselves nor the Green; the first half of his Green Pact. Instead Y'ffre told the elves to respect the Green, to ask it kindly to move itself, and so the Green would follow and shape itself into their shelter. Thirdly Y'ffre sang the song of beasts, granting them to the Bosmer as their nourishment; the second half of the Green Pact. He told them to never eat plants, to consume only meat and to never let it waste.\n\nWhen all his stories were told and he was pleased, Y'ffre formed the last of the Ooze into the prison and punishment of any Pact-Breakers who would defile the Green or themselves.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Multiple centuries of proxy feiting and bloody struggle between #LORE [compendium_aedra]#!-worshipping Barsaebic and #LORE [compendium_daedra]#!-worshipping Atataric factions served to unseam and polarize the Ayleid society, and empty Ald-Cyrod of much innocent blood.To the contemporaries, the Narfinsel hostilities seemed to never end, but like all things, they too came to pass. In 1E 198, the Aran of Atatar crushed the Aedraphiles in the infamous Scouring of Wendelbek, rendering the movement weak and disorganized. The Barsaebic vestiges fled Southeast, towards the Argonian borderlands of Shadowfen, Blackwood, and Keener Coast. This marked the triumph of the Atatarics and the unconditional primacy of Daedra worship in Cyrodiil until the Alessian Rebellion in 1E 242, not even half a century after the climax of the Schism.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Previously, the Potentates had served as the most trusted advisors to the Reman Emperors.\nWhile the Potentate's rule lasted nearly half a millennium, it was far from stable - Versidue-Shaie and his successor Savirien-Chorak had to put down numerous rebellions against their often tyrannical rule. However, their reign also saw the implementation of the Imperial Guild Act and the founding of many of the guilds that can be found throughout Tamriel today.\nThe Akaviri Potentate finally came to an end in 2E 430, when Savirien-Chorak and all of his heirs were assassinated by the Morag Tong (though same say it was the Dark Brotherhood) in a single night.
