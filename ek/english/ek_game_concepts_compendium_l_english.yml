As part of the divine contract of creation, the Aedra are also thought to be killable.

As such, they have retained most of their divine power, and are far more active than the #LORE [compendium_aedra]#!.\nThe sixteen most powerful Daedra are known as the #bold Daedric Princes#!, each ruling over their own plane of Oblivion said to be a part of their very self. The other Daedra, who take many different shapes like Dremora, Atronachs or Skamps, most often serve the Princes.\n\nWorshipping the Daedric Princes and bargaining with Daedra in general is often considered illegal in many parts of Tamriel, so these practices are often carried out in secret. Some races, such as the Reachfolk, Orcs, and Dunmer, openly worship the Daedra, which has earned them the suspicion of others. Meanwhile the Khajiit do not distinguish between Aedra and Daedra at all.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

 game_concept_compendium_alchemy:0 "Alchemy"
 game_concept_compendium_alchemy_desc:0 "An art as old as time, #bold Alchemy#! is the process through which someone combines and mixes, boils, or distills several ingredients to form a poison, or a potion. This art was supposedly codified by Asliel Direnni, but most people in Tamriel already knew how boiling a plant could cure a fever, or what bones should one crush to produce a potent poison.\n\nAlchemical ingredients come in very various forms, such as plants or leaves, animal parts, undead remnants, and even Daedric summons. This makes alchemy a potentially very lucrative and very dangerous trade, as the most expensive ingredients produce the most powerful poisons and potions, but are also hidden in the most deadly places.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Those who decided to follow him, the Magna-Ge, teared their own holes as they followed Magnus, which became known as the stars.\n\nHe is still revered in the Altmeri and Breton pantheons, and followers of Magnus can be found throughout Tamriel. Though whether or not he can be considered an Aedra is open to debate.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

So named because he features prominently in most cosmogonies as a casualty of creation, killed by the other gods in their anger at his trickery.\n\nHe convinced his fellow gods to join him in his project to construct a new plane. Halfway through, the Architect #LORE [compendium_magnus]#! learned the truth of the Missing God's designs and departed, leading an exodus of gods remembered as the Magna-Ge.\n\nThe remaining gods who chose to complete the project and lost most of their powers in the process became the #LORE [compendium_aedra]#!, the Earthbones and Ehlnofey, the latter of which would eventually become the mortal races.\n\nWhether they revere or abhor him, most agree the Missing God played a pivotal role in enabling the existence of the mortal plane, and as such life as we know it. Opinions diverge whereas the existence of mortal life is a blessing — a position held by most beliefs sympathetic or neutral towards him — or a curse — the stance of most faiths that actively see Mundus as a barrier to immortality and a fall from grace.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

The Schism began the twilight of the Imperatum Saliache and the Ayleid civilization as a whole. Some would call it a civil war and they would technically be correct. Multiple centuries of proxy feiting and bloody struggle between #LORE [compendium_aedra]#!-worshipping Barsaebic and #LORE [compendium_daedra]#!-worshipping Atataric factions served to unseam and polarize the Ayleid society, and empty Ald-Cyrod of much innocent blood.To the contemporaries, the Narfinsel hostilities seemed to never end, but like all things, they too came to pass. In 1E 198, the Aran of Atatar crushed the Aedraphiles in the infamous Scouring of Wendelbek, rendering the movement weak and disorganized. The Barsaebic vestiges fled Southeast, towards the Argonian borderlands of Shadowfen, Blackwood, and Keener Coast. This marked the triumph of the Atatarics and the unconditional primacy of Daedra worship in Cyrodiil until the Alessian Rebellion in 1E 242, not even half a century after the climax of the Schism.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."

Previously, the Potentates had served as the most trusted advisors to the Reman Emperors.\nWhile the Potentate's rule lasted nearly half a millennium, it was far from stable - Versidue-Shaie and his successor Savirien-Chorak had to put down numerous rebellions against their often tyrannical rule. However, their reign also saw the implementation of the Imperial Guild Act and the founding of many of the guilds that can be found throughout Tamriel today.\nThe Akaviri Potentate finally came to an end in 2E 430, when Savirien-Chorak and all of his heirs were assassinated by the Morag Tong (though same say it was the Dark Brotherhood) in a single night. The Empire crumbled, and the Interregnum began.\n\nYou can find more lore entries in the #LORE [compendium]#!."
