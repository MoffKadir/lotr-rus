The Akaviri Potentate had lost control over the other provinces over the last few decades, and the final blow has been dealt when Cyrodiil itself rose against them.\n\nThe only thing that is left to do is to ensure that never again should an Akaviri lord be allowed to rule over us...\nTo this end, the Tsaesci Act has been drafted and presented to the various lords of Cyrodiil. Any Tsaesci ruler immediately loses any right to any land, and every major Tsaesci settlement will be forcefully expelled from our land."
