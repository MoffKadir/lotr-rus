  dragon_cult.0001.desc:0 "Since the ruinous Dragon War, these lands have been cast into turmoil, caught in the tides of petty mortal wars and the false peace under complacent, guileless kings. But no more. We have reforged this land like a blade, and held it aloft heavenward as an offering to the Dragons. Soon, the shadow of great wings will fall upon this land like a protective spell, and great claws will seize upon me to name me their champion, the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName] below the gods.\n\nI proclaim the return in the dragon's tongue, as if it were a shout - KEIZAAL LOS UN! Skyrim is ours, reborn three times - in dragon-fire, in Ysgrams-tongue, in time-without-time! The mountains, the trees, the rivers and the forests hear and submit. My subjects hear and understand. Resistance will come, of course. If none else, the Greybeards and their treasonous patron will rile up those who defy us. Let them! I could not ask for a better feast to prepare for the arrival.\n\nAncient shadows and dust follow in my wake. I am certain this portents an old and powerful guest, who will arrive to bestow upon me the greatest of honours. I should make sure to receive such an august presence in a seat that befits it."

  dragon_cult.0002.desc:0 "Finally, the emissary arrives: a whithered old dragon priest, bearing the tattered robes of [draugr_dude.GetHerHis] ancient and noble station, accosts me one night in the empty corridors of my palace. [draugr_dude.GetHerHis|U] cracked lips come unfurled, and a whisper like a howling wind miles in the distance addresses me in Dovahzul,\n\n"Do not ask whence I come, oh [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], for I gave my word to Sahrotnax ne'er to speak it. Know only that the dragons will return, sooner now that you have prepared a perch for them. Long ago I was granted these masks to keep, for it is foretold that one would be claimed by one who fits thy mantle."\n\n[draugr_dude.GetSheHe|U] produces a few masks from beneath [draugr_dude.GetHerHis] rags, each pulsing with great powers from beyond the maw of time..."

  dragon_cult.0002.d:0 "I shall forge my own destiny without the boons of the Dragons."
