 divines.0002.t:0 "A Sibyl Rests"
 divines.0002.desc:0 "One of the holy Sibyls of Dibella, [dead_sibyl_of_dibella.GetFullNameNicknamed], [dead_sibyl_of_dibella.GetDeathReason]. This is an enormous loss to all the faithful followers of the Lady of Love."
 divines.0002.a:0 "Our Blessed Lady will guide her soul."
 divines.0004.t:0 "A New Sibyl Was Found!"
 divines.0004.desc:0 "After performing the secretive Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sibyl, the faithful priesthood of Dibella has been able to localize her new Sibyl: [new_sibyl_of_dibella.GetFullNameNicknamed]!\n\nThe Sibyls of Dibella act as direct links between mortals and the Lady of Love, transmitting her sacred message to all her followers.\n\n"
divines.0004a.desc:0 "After performing the secretive Exalted Protocol of the Dibellan Sibyl, the faithful priesthood of Dibella has been able to localize her new Sibyl:\n\n...me?\n\nThe Sibyls of Dibella act as direct links between mortals and the Lady of Love, transmitting her sacred message to all her followers. And they think that person is me?\n\nIt is a great honour to any family to have birthed a Sibyl, but can I leave my responsibilities as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] behind?"
 divines.0004b.desc:0 "[new_sibyl_of_dibella.GetFullNameNicknamed] is my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('new_sibyl_of_dibella'))], and it is a great honor to any devout family to have their members be declared a Sibyl."
 divines.0004.a:0 "A blessed day!"
 divines.0004.b: "A blessed day!"
 divines.0004.c:0 "Wait... I cannot give them up!"
 divines.0004.d:0 "With all my heart, yes!"
 divines.0004.e:0 "No, I simply cannot."
 divines.0005.t:0 "A Link to the Divine"
 divines.0005a.desc:0 "One of my servants comes rushing into the hall where I am meeting with my advisors.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], a great blessing has befallen your court" she says, panting. "A messenger of the Divine, a holy Sibyl of Dibella has arrived and is requesting your patronage while she carries out her sacred mission here in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. And even better, it is your [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('guest'))], [guest.GetFullNameNicknamed]!"\n\nAs a direct link between mortals and the Lady of Love, having a Sibyl around would certainly be a boon to the commonfolk. Hosting them would also perhaps reflect well on #italic me#!."
