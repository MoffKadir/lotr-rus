  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.desc:0 "I thirst for #bold blood#!. This unceasing hunger is my lot as a Vampire, something I cannot shake off as it beckons my very own soul. As I take sight of my situation I cannot help but wonder whether I should drop all pretense or cling to the shadows. While I can hide for now, a better opportunity to reveal myself may one day arrive - or I might be denounced unexpectedly!\n\nThis is a crucial decision as much of the world is unforgiving to my ilk..."
  ek_secret_trait_event.0001.option1:0 "I will leave them in the dark."

  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.t:0 "The Beast Within"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.desc:0 "A beast calls inside me, eager to consume, rip and tear its prey. Lycanthropes know this feeling all too well and its consequences lead us to hide from the public. By keeping a low profile I can avoid the anger that many would channel in my direction. Yet revealing who I really am could be the right move.\n\nWhat to do, follow the herd or bring out the fangs? "
  ek_secret_trait_event.0002.option1:0 "I should not tempt public outrage."

  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.desc:0 "I play with life and death — mostly the latter by engaging in the Dark Arts: Necromancy. The feeling of toying with the undead is one of many a skilled mage may know but which the majority of the world considers utterly sinful!\n\nThus I must choose carefully, do I tell everyone that I practice Necromancy or keep my skills to myself?"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0003.option1:0 "My plans will be easier if I omit this information."

  ek_secret_trait_event.0005.desc:0 "All hail the great pirate [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]! I have lived a life of legendary piratical exploits, and collected much plunder and wealth, but this is my greatest prize to date: I have become the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] of [primary_title.GetName]. Now, enthroned, I face a choice.\n\nShall I settle down, and abandon my loyal crew, and rule my [primary_title.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip] as any other autocrat might? Or shall I eschew the bloated bureaucracy of landbound regimes, and lead [primary_title.GetName] as the greatest captain in history?"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0005.option1:0 "Arr matey!"

  ek_secret_trait_event.0006.desc:0 "The Aurbis is home to many beings of great power, both malevolent and benign. Particularly noteworthy in my mind are the Daedric Princes of Oblivion. The path to gaining favor with such a powerful and fickle entity is certain to be treacherous - but for good or for ill I have decided that my own worship shall be thusly pledged.\n\nAnd yet, many of lesser mind do not look kindly upon my new Prince, their followers, or the gifts that they bestow upon us. There are plenty of narrow-minded detractors who would wish or do ill upon me for my worship. Thus, despite my convictions, I find myself left with a choice.\n\nDo I advance the agenda of my Prince in secret, keeping my true allegiance clandestine to prying eyes while secretly working to attain our true goals? Or shall I proclaim my newfound faith openly, the judgment of fools be damned?"
  ek_secret_trait_event.0006.option1:0 "I shall serve in the shadows..."  
  ek_secret_trait_event.0006.option2:0 "I serve my Prince proudly!"
