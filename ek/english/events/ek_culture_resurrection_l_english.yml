Farewell, Jorrvaskr; farewell, Cyrod; farewell, o ship of ditransitively-wooded hull; farewell, ship of crystal mast. When our forefathers watched them go, they stood on Mora's snowy shores and they still knew how to see the sun through the mist and snow of our beloved skies.\n\nThose days are long gone. The chill, the pall, the frostfall; it has many names, but only one outcome. There is only cold, cold death for those left in Atmora. Like the sailors on Skyrim of old, we have had to sail long and sail far and sail never to see our home again. Our ships may be smaller than the Great Holds which carried the Nords back to the Throat of the World, but they serve their purpose. We have finally abandoned the frozen continent; we may finally begin anew upon its successor."

Our time is past, and our old ways gone; our language is heard no more, and around us are only strange faces. We see no Galen lands, no remnants of our great tribes, and almost no hope that we shall ever take root again. But perhaps not all is lost.\n\nSo many myths abound of ancient Galenites protected by forgotten gods, like the seven sleepers of Phrygias, still hiding in their cave; or the Daphneic druids of Bergama, who, having healed the wrong lord, turned into laurel trees to protect themselves; or those who hide among the covens."

And perhaps one day we will again be one people, with a land to call our own.\n\nNow, I must decide my path. Who am I to take with me on my adventure?"
