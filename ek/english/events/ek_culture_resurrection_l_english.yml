Our people have grown too many and the soil too bleak to sustain ourselves much longer. It is time for me to lead my people back into the harsh world outside."

Farewell, Jorrvaskr; farewell, Cyrod; farewell, o ship of ditransitively-wooded hull; farewell, ship of crystal mast. When our forefathers watched them go, they stood on Mora's snowy shores and they still knew how to see the sun through the mist and snow of our beloved skies.\n\nThose days are long gone. The chill, the pall, the frostfall; it has many names, but only one outcome. There is only cold, cold death for those left in Atmora. Like the sailors on Skyrim of old, we have had to sail long and sail far and sail never to see our home again. Our ships may be smaller than the Great Holds which carried the Nords back to the Throat of the World, but they serve their purpose. We have finally abandoned the frozen continent; we may finally begin anew upon its successor."

I look around and I see no army - we cannot carve ourselves a realm by force. May we yet make for us a home?\n\nA decision is quickly reached. We will send out scouts, small bands of bold men and women who are to go their separate ways and seek their fortunes as traders, mercenaries or otherwise. The rest will remain hidden for now. And perhaps one day we will again be one people, with a land to call our own.\n\nNow, I must decide my path. Who am I to take with me on my adventure?"
