However, his bones never came to rest completely. They still thirst for blood and vengeance, and I shall empower them to satisfy this desire.\n\nA dragon remains a formidable entity, even in death, but not formidable enough to withstand my necromantic abilities. With such a minion under my control, I will undoubtedly become unstoppable."

There is no looming threat in this place; it is a sacred ground, open to the sky and adorned with statues and blooming flowers. In the center of it all stands a gigantic hourglass, so strangely beautiful in its otherworldly form that it must surely be a gift from Alkosh, the Cat of Time, himself.

And after all, this transformation will unfold gradually. The remaining monks of Sunspire will steadfastly guard the temple and welcome the pilgrims who still seek its sacred grounds.\nEven as the structure begins to fade, the legacy of Sunspire will endure throughout the ages."
 ek_special_buildings_events.0031_no_hs.desc:0 "The monks of Sunspire are far from pleased with my decision, but they must accept the new reality: it was my gold that held their temple together and it won't flow any longer.\n\nDespite the change, Sunspire will continue to be a sacred site for their faith, drawing pilgrims to its heights. Though they may now offer their prayers amid walls that are slowly crumbling, even in decay, this temple's grandeur will endure for a very long time."

Each room is adorned with more reliefs, pillars, and statues than the previous one, while the gardens are filled with beautiful flowers and exotic animals.\n\nSome may claim that it still falls short of capturing the opulence of the old palace, but even they cannot deny that it is once again a seat fit for a truly great [CHARACTER.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]."

The trees, once vibrant and green, are beginning to wither. The animals that used to dart between the trunks are vanishing. Fled, perhaps, or worse.\n\nAnd there’s something else. Spirits... they awaken. Vengeful ghosts, twisted by hatred. These are the Bosmer who rejected the Green Pact and were punished with death.
