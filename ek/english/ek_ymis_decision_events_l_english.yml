 life_extension.0300.desc:0 "For so long, I have worked to master death. I have inflicted it on others, I have brought them back, and I have used it as a tool. But death has used me in turn, and I have been at its mercy. No longer. I have corrected this.\n\nI have gathered ritual tools, ritual magic, and, most importantly, ritual sacrifices. I have ripped my own soul from my body and cast it aside. I face death without it, invulnerable and insensible to its grasp. For the price of one soul, I have gained immortality and mastery — and an eternity in which to enjoy it."
 life_extension.0300a:0 "Death serves me!"

 life_extension.0301.t:0 "Lich Ascension"
 life_extension.0301.desc:0 "I have worked to master death. I have inflicted it on others, brought them back, and used it as a tool. But even as I have used death, death too has used me. And it is not willing to let me go.\n\nThough I gathered ritual tools, ritual magic, and ritual sacrifices, I could not rip my own soul from my body. The pain was — is — excruciating. I have glimpsed death from within, and I know I am not ready to die. But with my soul within my body, death remains my master. It is a jealous one, and, even now, I can feel its mark upon me. My brush with ascension left me and my soul vulnerable to death, and I can feel that a rot has set in within my body."
 life_extension.0301a:0 "I have made a mistake."

 life_extension.0302.t:0 "Lich Ascension"
 life_extension.0302.desc:0 "I had worked to master death. I had inflicted it on others and brought them back. I even thought of death as a tool that I could use. But in truth it used me. I thought that with ritual tools, magic, and sacrifices, I could ascend beyond its grasp. But I could not.\n\nAt first, I thought the ritual was succeeding. My soul left my body, this I know: I can feel myself soulless. But something went wrong. I thought that I would face death and rise above it, but I have not. I am far greater than mere mortals who die, or so I thought; yet now I feel closer to the sacrifices lying dead in my ritual chamber. I was arrogant to think I could conquer death, and the reward for my arrogance is to feel it for myself. With my soul gone, there is not much time before I join my sacrifices.\n\nThese are my final moments."
 life_extension.0302a:0 "Death comes to us all"

 stress_loss_experimentalist_decision_desc:0 "I will conduct a new experiment to decipher the arcane and turn my back to the everyday struggles for a moment. I may even learn something in the process - or do some unexpected harm. But a great mind like mine needs an adequate outlet and the risk of failure just adds to the suspension of the process."
 stress_loss_experimentalist_decision_tooltip:0 "You will redirect your thoughts to a new magical experiment and lose some stress in the process."

 ek_stress_trait_coping_decisions.1152.desc:0 "Why should I stay in the boundaries of established magic? With some creativity and bravery I can test out the limitations of the arcane and find new uses for old spells. This will satisfy my curiosity and may teach me something in the process."
 ek_stress_trait_coping_decisions.1152.a:0 "There is much to learn."

The issue is that I am not sure what many of these effects actually are until I try them out. Fortunately, with [torture_victim.GetFirstName], I have the ideal volunteer in my dungeon for such experiments..."

 ek_stress_trait_coping_decisions.1154.desc:0 "While perusing ancient arcane tomes, I came across an interesting read by one Magister Varkenel from House Telvanni.\n\nIn this article, the author describes the creation of a friendly but weird creature called Vvardvark. Aside from being a fitting companion for a mage such as myself, this experiment could give me some insights into transmuting living beings."

 ek_stress_trait_coping_decisions.1155.desc:0 "I cannot help but notice that time has not been kind to my thrall [undead_courtier.GetFirstName] as [undead_courtier.GetHerHis] physical form is severely lacking. Surely, a necromancer of my standing should do something about that, particularly a necromancer as crafty as myself.\n\nConsequently, I order [undead_courtier.GetHerHim] into my laboratory, where I can commence some experimental modifications on that undead body."
