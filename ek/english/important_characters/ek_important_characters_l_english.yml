In 2E 400, he ousted House Cuptor from Bravil and appointed an Ilniviri Proconsul in their stead, and boldly proclaimed Orsinium a full fledged Province of the Empire.\n\nYears passed and resentment pooled until Savirien-Chorak's lifeless body was found in 2E 430 in his Senchal palace, killed by Mephalan fanatics called 'the Morag Tong'. They did not let off his direct heirs either, just like the Remans of old. Tensions have finally boiled over as it became painfully clear: the Second Empire had begun its final dissolution."
