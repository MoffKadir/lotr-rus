 imp_char_akavir_100_desc:0 "It is tempting to write off Savirien-Chorak as the unready steward suddenly thrust into absolute power... with predictable results. Still, the truth is something more prosaic: Versidue-Shaie ruling the Empire for so long was a miracle that could hardly repeat itself.\n\nOverwhelmed by the government tailored for his omnipresent sire, Savirien-Chorak fell victim to executive paralysis. Crises would be brought to his attention one day, only to receive a tepid reply weeks later, long after the local authorities had overruled him.\n\nNot one to be dismissed entirely, Savirien-Chorak was savvy enough to elevate Orsinium to the provincial rank and to execute the insolent. On the latter note, he was #bold far less#! murderous than his father: 'Queen of Fangs' — the household blade — beheaded less nobles during his #bold entire reign#! than during #bold the sole Bardmont Challenge#!, when royal gore frequently bathed the sword.\n\nThat made the case of Cyril II Cuptor all the more important. Publicly endorsing a satire of your liege is a sure path to execution, as the Imperial Count of Bravil learned the hard way in 2E 400! Furthermore, Savirien-Chorak appointed Sien-Drassi as Proconsul instead of allowing the succession of Prince Venaros to his impudent father, thoroughly humiliating House Cuptor.\n\nYears passed and resentment pooled until Savirien-Chorak's lifeless body was found in 2E 430 in his palace of Senchal, killed by Mephalan fanatics called 'the Morag Tong'. They did not let off his direct heirs either, just like the Remans of old. Simmering tensions finally erupted with the writing on the wall: the Second Empire had begun its final dislocation.\n\nYet a little known descendant known as Aixnieras-Ves would make a surprising turnaround..."

 #King Aenedhel, King of Falinesti
 imp_char_camoran_017:0 ""
 imp_char_camoran_017_desc:0 "Keeping the peace within a Bosmer clan is challenging enough, so imagine how taxing it must be to keep the peace between clans. Aenedhel 'the Peacemaker', primus inter pares among Camoran kings, met the task head on with unnerving ability. There was no conflict he could not defuse, no misunderstanding he could not solve, no nemeses that could deny reconciliation under his mediation. The saying went that 'Aenedhel's words strike more true than Eplear's arrows'; a gauge of his diplomatic ability.\n\nMourning shrouded the wards in 2E 420 once it was known Falinesti and its inhabitants vanished, presumed dead. Wailings and cries sounded across the country, and Silvenar Edhelorn took ill for three years before his condition bettered. 'The Peacemaker' became 'the Lamented'.\n\nWith the collapse of Imperial authority and no Peacemaker to facilitate diplomacy, the divided Camoran kings all staked their claim on the High Kingship, with the Silvenar and Grahtwood branches at the head of the pack. Y'ffre's Garden edged towards total anarchy."

 #Nord Adventurer who kicked out previous Bruma ruler

 imp_char_frostbeard_98_desc:0 "King Borvir ruled Bruma through right of conquest, slaying Imperial Count Janus on the footsteps of the comital castle.\n\nAenar Frost-Beard roamed the woods of County Bruma, making a living as a troll hunter, more than enough to care for himself and his son Borvir. Tragically, he was killed in a dispute with some racketeering guards; They wanted a third of his loot rather the legal toll of a tenth. Borvir pleaded with the Captain of the guard to punish the wrongdoers but was thrown in a cell and would have died there if not for the Count's grace that saved him.\n\nBelieving in the tales of fair kingship, Borvir petitioned Imperial Count Janus to intercede on his behalf, recounting his woes. To his credit, Janus proposed a settlement, which decreed the following: Borvir would be compensated with twice the value of the stolen troll fat, Aenar's funeral would be paid for by the state and a special waiver on duelling was granted so that Borvir could deal with the murderers.\n\nBorvir wanted... more. He wanted nothing less than the Captain's head! It was a cost Janus was unwilling to bear so he reiterated his offer which Borvir declined.\n\nThe next month, the involved guardsmen were found dead and robbed blind. Borvir had sworn a blood oath on Janus and led a warband of fellow wronged Nords. In 2E 432, he conquered Bruma and fulfilled his oath. A moot was convened thereafter, as the clan-heads confirmed Borvir as 'King of Bruma' and his son's right to succeed him. Harald would do so in 2E 439, sitting in the shadow of the man he replaced."

 # Cyril II aka guy who ridiculed the Potentate, then got executed. what great surprise
 imp_char_cuptor_98:0 ""
 imp_char_cuptor_98_desc:0 "No one really knows what compelled Imperial Count Cyril II of Bravil to voraciously consume #LORE [compendium_potentate]#! satire. Perhaps some unknown setback at the hands of a magnate? Stonewalling by his Cisnibenese prefects? And yet his line was one of the more trusted ones in Savirien-Chorak's Cyrodiil...\n\nCyril had official seals, exemption from many taxes and the right to maintain a retinue — a distinctive status symbol in post-Bardmont Tamriel. The Potentate really saw the Cuptor as kin. All the while, creeping addiction sapped the deep respect Cyril had for Savirien.\n\nCyril ran amok to the point of patronizing the anonymous author behind the 'Sevilio Coraccus' saga. Sevilio Coraccus is a mercurial king with a lisp prone to inaction, a thinly veiled critic of his liege melding reality and fiction to great effect. Most readers agree that it reached the apex in 'Sevilio Coraccus: Shadow of Varsidius' and 'Sevilio Coraccus: the Memoirs of Sidorius'.\n\nCyril grew more insolent off his readinds until he went too far. As the Elder Council was convening to address yet another crisis festering because of non-commital Savirien he quipped that 'the original really cannot be matched by Sevilio'. Savirien-Chorak — or his trusted aide — heard this and secretly arranged for an investigation. Numerous copies of 'Sevilio Coraccus' were found in the walls of his mansion, along with correspondences and promissory notes proving his financial ties to the author.\n\nCondemned for high treason, Cyril II was stripped of his comital office and personally beheaded by the Potentate using Queen of Fangs. Officially spared unlike his father, Prince Venaros was allowed to depart albeit chased by 'loyalists', willing to dispatch him to enter the good graces of their sovereign."
