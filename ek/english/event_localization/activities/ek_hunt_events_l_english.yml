 ek_hunt.1001.desc:0 "As the hunt goes on, you find yourself separated from your group, and in a part of the hunting grounds you have never seen before.\nAround you the singing of the birds and the various noises made by bigger beasts have grown quiet, and you can feel a higher presence overseeing this land.\n\nAs you slowly press on, you find a small and secluded shrine, dedicated to none other than the [Glossary( 'Daedric Prince', 'DAEDRA_GLOSS' )] Hircine, Father of the Hunt and Prince of Lycanthropy!"
 ek_hunt.1001.a:0 "This place is cursed, I will destroy this shrine!"
 ek_hunt.1001.a.tt:0 "The Prince will be midly displeased, and your hunting party might find itself without any prey to catch..."
 ek_hunt.1001.b:0 "Leave the shrine undisturbed."

 ek_hunt.1002.desc:0 "As I take a nightly stroll through the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], I think about that time I killed the great white [ROOT.Char.MakeScope.Var('animal_type').GetFlagName]. As I ponder and reminisce about that event, a ghostly [ROOT.Char.MakeScope.Var('animal_type').GetFlagName] appears before me. Before I can ready my [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')], the apparition starts speaking in a loud, deep voice.\n\n"Well met, hunter. I am the spirit of the hunt, just one glimpse of the glorious stalker that your kind calls Hircine, and what I offer you is an eternal hunt. Serve me, and you shall be granted plenty of prey in my Hunting Grounds."\n\nAstonished, I struggle to find my words."
 ek_hunt.1002.a:0 "Take that, you demon! Begone!"
 ek_hunt.1002.a.tt:0 "You strike the creature with your [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')], but the beast is faster and darts away."

 ek_hunt.1002.b.tt:0 "You dart away like a frightened animal."
 ek_hunt.1002.c:0 "Bless us as we hunt, O Hircine."
 ek_hunt.1002.c.tt:0 "Help us to hunt with honor, and bring in prey both lawful and bountiful."
 ek_hunt.1002.d:0 "I bow to you, Mighty Lord Hircine."

 ek_hunt.1003.desc:0 "As the hunt goes on through the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], me and my group find ourselves surrounded by plant-like creatures shaped like a female humanoid who commanded a group of wild [activity.Custom('GetAnimalPlural')]. I heard someone shout "Spriggans!" before the kerfuffle started. Spriggans are known as sacred protectors of nature, highly revered by those who worship nature in their daily practices.\n\nI can't help but wonder if this area is being targeted by hunters too much."

 ek_hunt.1004.desc:0 "As the full moon shined on through the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], me and my group got lost while chasing the [activity.Custom('GetAnimalType')]. I heard a low growl and suddenly I was alone with the thing.\n\nIts eyes were almost human but in all other aspects it was a wolf. I remembered the bedtime stories I was told as a little [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')], where regular people turned into monsters when one of the moons was full. The thing paced around me slowly, getting a good look at me while sniffing. Suddenly, it howled a mournful hymn to the Hunt-King.\n\nI had to act, quickly."
 ek_hunt.1004.a:0 "Come on! You monster!"
 ek_hunt.1004.a.success:0 "You defeat the Werewolf"

 ek_hunt.1006.desc:0 "While trying to scout the area for any [ROOT.Char.MakeScope.Var('animal_type').GetFlagName] tracks, I hear a familiar yet disturbing noise. A small cliff racer, aggressively shrieking above us, chose to make itself known.\n\nEscaping might be the only chance we have of returning home unscathed, but killing it may ensure the safety of these lands."
 ek_hunt.1006.a:0 "Here it comes!"

Yet, the familiarity of the tried-and-true bone called to me, carrying the memories of countless successful hunts, a bone I had known well and could depend on."
 ek_hunt.1007.a:0 "I will risk the new bone."
 ek_hunt.1007.b:0 "The true and tested bones of [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetAnimalPlural')] would do the trick."
 ek_hunt.1007.c:0 "Which stories do these bones tell?"
