A warlord named Emeesh Poison-Tongue learned of this sickness, and sent a band of marauders to rob the weakened city of its wealth. Although she too was afflicted by the sickness, Zoreh the Tenacious stood guard alone.\n\nShe knew that the marauder's numbers were too great for her alone, so she devised a plan to trick them into thinking the illness had passed and that the city's defenders were ready. She ran across Bergama and lit every signal fire, lighting up the city. This heroic act rallied the city's sick defenders. They took the field, and although Emeesh's marauders panicked and attempted to flee, they were all killed. Ultimately, Zoreh died later that night from the illness, but her memory lives on.\n\nEvery year, at the New Life Festival, the citizens of Bergama honor her sacrifice with a race to light up several signal fires throughout the city. This tradition spread throughout Hammerfell and it has become one of the most anticipated Redguard events.\n\nOn this occasion, [runner.GetShortUIName] was the fastest in [GetPlayer.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], attracting my attention."

The Unknown Passenger tells of a cloaked figure on a ship who none of the other travelers recall boarding. The Lost Fawn in the Woods learns a stalking wolf killed its mother and wears her skin, but in its haste to flee it takes shelter in the wolf's den.
