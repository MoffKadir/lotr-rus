 hist_communion.0001.desc.ghosthist:0 "I feel the presence of the Ghost Hist before I can see it, emerging from the dense fog of the marshes. Its ethereal aura permeates the air, a faint luminescence casting a ghostly glow amidst the swirling mist.\n\nApproaching cautiously, a chill runs down my spine as if the Hist itself is watching, its ghostly whispers brushing against my consciousness.\n\nThis communion holds the promise of unlocking secrets that transcend the boundaries of the living world - if I can prove myself worthy."

 # General Events
 hist_communion.0100.t:0 "The Form of a Behemoth"
 hist_communion.0100.desc:0 "In this era of chaos and turmoil, my people are forced to adapt to new hardships. Since time immemorial, the Hist has been our stalwart ally, offering strength in our times of great need. As I kneel beneath the mighty branches of the ancient tree, I sense that now may be the moment to beseech for a special gift — the transformation into a behemoth, a creature of unparalleled strength.\n\nBut I am aware that such a metamorphosis would come with a grave cost. It would exact a toll on my mind, stripping away layers of consciousness and reason, with the risk of reducing me to a primal, instinct-driven existence in the end."
 hist_communion.0100.a:0 "I am willing to take this path"
 hist_communion.0100.a.success:0 "The Hist changes you"
 hist_communion.0100.a.failure:0 "The Hist rejects your wish"
 hist_communion.0100.b:0 "A great risk... but such power!"
 hist_communion.0100.c:0 "I can serve the Hist in other ways"

 hist_communion.0101.t:0 "The Birth of a Hatchling"
 hist_communion.0101.desc:0 "Sometimes life-changing events unfold in the most unexpected moments. As I kneel in prayer before the Hist, a cracking sound pierces the air. An egg, bathed in golden sap, splits open before my eyes, revealing a Hatchling stretching its head into the fresh air for its very first cry. Instinctively, I gather it into my arms, and immediately it falls silent.\n\nIs this a sign from the Hist? Am I meant to care for this Hatchling? The local Hist minders believe so, but ultimately, the decision rests with me."
 hist_communion.0101.a:0 "Accept this [hatchling.GetTitledFirstName] as a gift from the Hist!"
 hist_communion.0101.b:0 "[new_parent.GetTitledFirstName] shall raise this [hatchling.GetTitledFirstName]"
 hist_communion.0101.c:0 "Dismiss it as a coincidence"

 hist_communion.0102.t:0 "Wisdom of a Hist Speaker"
 hist_communion.0102.desc:0 "The Hist itself rarely speaks in clear ways. Its communication manifests through the rustling of leaves in the wind, the patterns in which bark grows, and the visions induced by ingesting its sap — these are the forms in which it expresses its will most often. These signs are enigmatic and easily misunderstood, which is why Hist speakers like [hist_speaker.GetTitledFirstName] dedicate their lives to studying the subtle language of the Hist.\n\nAs I hear [hist_speaker.GetTitledFirstName] begin to lecture some of the locals about the Hist's will, I draw closer, eager to hear what [hist_speaker.GetSheHe] has to say."
 hist_communion.0102.a:0 "Listen to what [hist_speaker.GetTitledFirstName] has to say"

 hist_communion.0102.c.failure:0 "You make a fool of yourself"

 hist_communion.0103.t:0 "A Voice in the Leaves?"
 hist_communion.0103.desc:0 "It started as a light breeze, gently stirring the swamp flowers around me, but suddenly, a gust of wind envelops me, rustling the Hist's branches and orchestrating a melodic dance with the leaves. It's an eerie yet beautiful experience, captivating everyone around me, causing them to pause their tasks and listen intently.\n\nCould there be a message concealed within these sounds? The possibility hangs in the air, drawing us closer to the tree, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Hist's ancient wisdom."
 hist_communion.0103.a:0 "Listen closely"
 hist_communion.0103.a.great_success:0 "The Hist speaks to you"

 hist_communion.0103.c:0 "That's just the wind"

 hist_communion.0104.t:0 "A Veil Lifted"
 hist_communion.0104.desc:0 "As I sit under the Hist, its blossoms blooming over my head and the sounds of the marshes all around me, I feel a peace of mind that I thought I had lost forever. Everything that plagued me feels small in comparison to the ancient being whose presence has pierced the veil resting over my mind for so long. I suddenly remember the time when I was unplagued by my own thoughts.\nCan it be? Can the Hist bring that back?\n\nThe whispering leaves seem to respond, their rustling a soothing lullaby that reaches into the depths of my soul. And for the first time in what feels like an eternity, I allow myself to hope for better days."
 hist_communion.0104.a:0 "My mind is my own."

 hist_communion.0105.t:0 "A Gift from The Hist"
 hist_communion.0105.desc:0 "As Saxhleel, we are part of something greater than individual ailments or sorrows. But even during this communion, where my mind is connected to the Hist, I can still feel my body and its limitations. We must navigate these swamps, walking, seeing, and fighting as necessary. Yet, my body is damaged, unable to fulfill these tasks completely.\n\nPressing my face against the rough bark, seeking solace, I feel a warmth spreading from the tree into me - a gentle, undeniable force. It fills the void left by my injury with a soothing balm, restoring something I had feared lost forever."
 hist_communion.0105.a:0 "I can already feel it"

 hist_communion.0106.t:0 "The Sap Flows"
 hist_communion.0106.desc:0 "There are mysteries within the Hist that we may never fully comprehend. One of these is the manner in which it wields its magic. Those who harness its powers are capable of both wondrous and fearsome feats — an ability that I believed lost to me when my body was disrupted and the flow of magicka permanently halted.\n\nYet, as I listen to the steady flow of Hist sap coursing through the tree like blood through a body, I begin to grasp its most well known truth: nothing in this world is truly permanent. And If anything can restore my magical abilities, it is the Hist."
 hist_communion.0106.a:0 "Everything heals"

 hist_communion.0107.t:0 "Refound Vitality"
 hist_communion.0107.desc:0 "It is good to feel the Hist's presence once more, even if my joints creak like they are made of wood themselves as I sit in the tree's shade. Exhausted from the journey here, I dare to close my eyes for a few seconds. Upon opening them again, I notice a subtle change in the colors around me — the greens of the leaves appear more vibrant, the blues of the sky deeper and clearer. Even the air seems charged with a newfound energy, lifting the heaviness from my heart.\n\nI realize that the Hist has granted me a precious gift: the chance to experience vitality once more, if only for the fleeting years of my remaining life."
 hist_communion.0107.a:0 "I feel my strength coming back!"

 hist_communion.0108.t:0 "Lifted Curse"
 hist_communion.0108.desc:0 "We know that there are other mighty forces at play in Tamriel, and sometimes they even dare to meddle with us, the chosen people of the root. Coming to this communion, I bore the curse of a Daedric Prince upon me, as they sometimes think themselves high enough to treat us as their playthings.\n\nYet in the presence of our mighty Hist, their influence dwindles, and I feel that I can shed their curse just as a snake sheds its old skin."
 hist_communion.0108.a:0 "Thank you, mighty Hist!"

 hist_communion.0109.t:0 "The Hist Provides"
 hist_communion.0109.desc:0 "The easiest way to receive a blessing from the Hist is by ingesting some of its sap. So, I approach the peaceful seat of my native Hist Tree, the bubbling swamp and the croaking of the frogs creating a relaxing ambiance around me.\n\nAs I touch its bark, I can hear my own name resonating in my head, as if the Hist itself is speaking to me. Encouraged by this, I hold my bowl under one of the branches, ready to catch every drop of the sacred liquor it may grant me."
 hist_communion.0109.a:0 "Wait for a few drops of Hist sap"
 hist_communion.0109.a.success:0 "The Hist offers you a blessing"

 hist_communion.0109.b:0 "Don't be obtrusive"

 hist_communion.0110.t:0 "Soft Moss Under the Branches"
 hist_communion.0110.desc:0 "I suddenly stumble upon a lovely spot near the Hist, a hidden grove with sun-warmed stones casting cool shadows where soft moss is growing. The tranquil murmur of the marshes fills the air, and the vibrant green hues of the moss invite weary travelers to rest.\n\nAs I stand there, contemplating, I wonder if it would be disrespectful to lay down for a while in such a sacred place. The Hist's presence looms above, inviting to prayer. Yet, the allure of the soft moss and the peaceful surroundings tempt me to pause and rejuvenate from the exhausting day."
 hist_communion.0110.a:0 "Take a short nap"
 hist_communion.0110.b:0 "Use this place for meditation"
 hist_communion.0110.c:0 "The perfect spot for an intense prayer"

 hist_communion.0111.t:0 "A Willing Vessel"
 hist_communion.0111.desc:0 "I'm surprised when [wannabe_behemoth.GetFirstName] approaches me. Having seen [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHim] engrossed in prayer for days, I did not expect to see [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHim] again until the end of the communion.\n\nBut now [wannabe_behemoth.GetSheHe] shows the scales of determination, and shares that the Hist has offered [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHim] the blessing of the behemoth form, enhancing [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHis] strength for the good of our tribe.\n\nYet, [wannabe_behemoth.GetSheHe] acknowledges this change could affect [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHis] mental abilities. Respectfully, [wannabe_behemoth.GetFirstName] seeks my permission to proceed with this transformation."
 hist_communion.0111.a:0 "Let [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHim] do it"
 hist_communion.0111.b:0 "Deny [wannabe_behemoth.GetHerHis] this wish"

 hist_communion.0200.t:0 "Amber Blessing"
 hist_communion.0200.desc:0 "It is time. The Hist has heard my pleas for the infamous amber blessing, secreting a fresh pool of amber plasm for me to bathe in. As I approach the glowing substance, I sense many eyes resting upon me, observing my decision with anticipation. The raw power emanating from the amber plasm is palpable, and it is shifting the very fabric of reality itself.\n\nI pause, contemplating the risks. If I finalize this ritual, there is a chance my mind could be consumed by the plasm, leaving it forever broken. Yet, the allure of such power is undeniable to those brave and bold enough to seek it—a test of will and resilience in the face of both physical and spiritual transformation."

 hist_communion.0201.t:0 "Holy Guardians"
 hist_communion.0201.desc:0 "There are many outsiders who fail to grasp the nuances of our faith and the opportunities it presents. They label the Hists that provide amber plasm as mad and dismiss them as misguided and dangerous. It is for this reason that we must take it upon ourselves to protect these sacred trees. Fortunately, there are many skilled guardians who dedicate their entire lives to safeguarding the sprawling temple cities we have built around our chosen Hists.\n\nWitnessing them in training is a sight to behold. And [amber_warrior.GetFirstName] stands out even among their ranks. [amber_warrior.GetHerHis|E] skin glows with the color of amber itself, and [amber_warrior.GetHerHis] face is marked with the solemn determination of [amber_warrior.GetHerHis] sacred duty."

 hist_communion.0300.t:0 "Sun Blessing"
 hist_communion.0300.desc:0 "As I watched the sun rise above the marshes this morning, I knew that today was the perfect day to seek my blessing. Its rays pierced the canopies and illuminated the Hist, making the droplets of Hist sap on it's bark shimmer like molten gold. There is more in this light than just the warmth I feel on my scales and the light flooding the swamp. It is infused with raw magicka, nourishing the Hist just as it absorbs water and earth.\n\nIf I receive my blessing today, I too will be able to harness the arcane in new and powerful ways."

 hist_communion.0301.desc:0 "Some of the other tribes may call us prideful, but how can one not be proud when connected to such perfect beings as our Hist trees? They tower above everything else in the marshes, tall and strong, their branches bathing in the sun’s light and drinking in its raw power.\n\nBut our Hist is not only powerful; it is also generous. As I stand near it, a shiver of energy suddenly creeps over my scales. The Hist shares a fraction of its might with me, and I feel like a puddle touched by the vast ocean."
 hist_communion.0301.a:0 "Restore your magicka"
 hist_communion.0301.b:0 "Redirect that flow"

 hist_communion.0400.t:0 "Ghost Scale"
 hist_communion.0400.desc:0 "This communion has been promising so far. Hidden by dense fog, I was able to experience the presence of my Hist in solitude, reflecting on the things that enable us to survive even in the most hostile environments. We Ghost People thrive where others perish; we find hope in darkness, purpose in death, and opportunity in everything that seems bleak.\n\nBut if I truly want to embody those ideals, I must go further, asking the pale Hist for its blessing to become a Ghost Scale. Only in this form can I truly serve it and my people to the fullest extent."

 hist_communion.0401.t:0 "White Shadows"
 hist_communion.0401.desc:0 "They move unseen most of the time, but after being in their proximity for a while, one starts to pick up the signs of their presence: movements concealed by the dense morning fog, the feeling of being constantly watched, and a stench in the air created by risen Bogwraiths. There are Ghost Scales all around the Hist, watching it from the shadows, ready to strike at any moment to bring down those who wish it harm, no matter what kind they may be.\n\nAt first, they made me feel uneasy, but after a while, I grew accustomed to them, feeling a sense of protection and thankfulness for their never-ending duty."
 hist_communion.0401.a:0 "There is something to be learned from them"
 hist_communion.0401.b:0 "They are proof of the resilience of our people"
 
 # End
 hist_communion.1000.t:0 "At an End"
 hist_communion.1000.desc.amberhist:0 "The communion is over, and my mind is still filled with the puzzling voices of Tsono Xuhil. Or are these just echoes of my own thoughts, spinning around like a fleshfly trapped in amber plasm?\n\nHowever it may be, it was an unforgettable experience to come this close to the mysteries surrounding the Amber Hist that stands guard over my people."
 hist_communion.1000.desc.sunhist:0 "The time has come to depart from this communion, but I am not sad, for every moment of it was a blessing that only my people truly know how to appreciate. I came closer to the sun than most beings will ever be able to.\n\nAnd I can still feel a certain warmth on my scales that will stay with me on the journey back to my home."
 hist_communion.1000.desc.ghosthist:0 "I came to this communion like a ghost myself, trudging through dark swamps, enveloped in fog, and devoid of light that never reaches the ground in these parts of the marshes. I am certain it will be the same on the way back, yet there has been a change: I have been touched by the pale Hist, and I no longer have to fear the horrors of Black Marsh — I am now a part of them."
 hist_communion.1000.desc:0 "Every Argonian is able to feel a connection to the Hist during their life, in one form or another. But to come as close to it as I did during this communion is a gift for which I am truly thankful.\n\nWhat I take home is more than a blessing or a healed injury; it is the knowledge that the Hist will always be there for us, and we for it."
