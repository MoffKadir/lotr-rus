I decided to follow its course until I found a cliff wall. Going up the cliff made me find a fairy circle composed of white cap mushrooms and, in its center, was the glorious apparition of the Ursine Guardian.\n\nThe awe of said visage almost cost me my life, for when I was paralyzed in wonderment, the ghostly bear attacked me, leaving me little room to evade."

 ek_pilgrimage.1032.desc:0 "I have come across a mammoth graveyard during my travels, as if guided by Kyne herself. Among the bones, I found a shrine to the Mother of Beasts. I issued a quick prayer for guidance, as it seemed fit. In the middle of my prayers, I heard an earth-trembling rumbling coming from behind me. A towering, transparent mammoth was charging right at me.\n\nI got out of the way and hid behind mammoth bones as quickly as I could and the beast got right past me. I pondered about what I should do."

One day, staring at another ice wall in search for clues, I've found a frozen Sabre Cat inside the glacier. I could hear a roar above me.\n\nWhen I turned my head up to see where the noise came from, I saw a majestic spectral sabre cat leaping down to my level. The creature stared at me and I stared back."

Now, only one Guardian Spirit stand before me and completing these Trials: the Troll. I have been attuned to the Goddess's will and presence for quite some time and I can see the path towards it.\n\nBefore even seeing the ghastly creature, I know it's there. Not because of its grunts or panting, but it's like I can feel it, beckoning me. I face the beast, with a respectful silence."

 ek_pilgrimage.1036.desc:0 "I find myself in the sanctified embrace of a pilgrimage site, a place suffused with the enigmatic teachings of Baan Dar, the Bandit God. As I sit amidst this sacred ground, the essence of his wisdom pervades the air, compelling me to contemplate the diverse interpretations of his teachings.\n\nI ponder the curious ways different cultures and faiths perceive Baan Dar. The Wood Elves' exploding chickens, the outsiders' Bandit God and tales of the Man of a Thousand Faces—the disparities in these views are stark. To my people, the true Khajiit, Baan Dar is not a mere legend or story but a way of life. It's in every action, from the enslaved breaking free to those fighting for their freedom."
