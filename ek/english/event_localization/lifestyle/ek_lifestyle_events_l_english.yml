 ek_lifestyles.0049.desc:0 "Lost in the pages of a treatise on shock spells, I recall the sting of the arcane backlash that set my path on this inquiry. Every mage has endured it: the miscast spell, the surge of uncontrolled magic recoiling upon oneself. It's a humbling reminder of the untamed power at our fingertips and the delicate art of its mastery.\n\nThe author claims shock to be more than just a spell: it is the manipulation of the Mundus' very weave. His theory suggests that when we cast shock, we agitate the fibers of reality, coaxing out the sparking essence of lightning itself. This perspective turns every miscast into a potential for insight, a glimpse into the fundamental workings of magic."

 ek_lifestyles.0126.desc:0 "It's always wise to listen attentively to the discussions among my subjects, especially when they believe themselves to be in a secure environment. This is the case as I catch a few sentences from [mayor.GetFirstName], a modest mayor in one of my cities. It seems [mayor.GetSheHe] is quite displeased by the additional fees imposed on [mayor.GetHerHim].. Not only that, but I also hear him expressing some rather unpleasant opinions about my enforcer [enforcer.GetFirstName] and the way things are handled in my realm.\n\nAs I approach, a hush falls over everyone in [mayor.GetHerHis] vicinity, as they await my reaction to this display of disrespect."
 ek_lifestyles.0126.a:0 ""[mayor.GetSheHe|U]'s right. I will order [enforcer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to be more lenient""

 ek_lifestyles.0127.desc:0 "Wherever rules exist, there is invariably someone who discovers a way to circumvent them. A wise ruler must acknowledge these realities and devise strategies to adapt - and I aspire to be counted among such wise rulers.\n\nPerhaps it's time to capitalize on the fact that many individuals navigate around custom fees through creative smuggling methods. Instead of directly opposing these smugglers, I could assist in establishing one of their networks within the lands of [neighboring_ruler.GetFirstName].\n\nIf this operation proves successful I could surely reap some noticeable profits."
 ek_lifestyles.0127.a:0 "This could work out rather well."
 ek_lifestyles.0127.a.success:0 "You establish a flourishinhg smuggling network"
 ek_lifestyles.0127.a.failure:0 "The network is a waste of money"
 ek_lifestyles.0127.b:0 "That's too risky."

 ek_lifestyles.0128.desc:0 "Everyone in my courtyard hastily makes way for my enforcer [enforcer.GetFirstName] as [enforcer.GetSheHe] steps confidently before my throne. It seems [enforcer.GetSheHe]'s been relishing [enforcer.GetHerHis] work lately, perhaps a bit too much as [enforcer.GetHerHis] following words suggest: "My liege, it's becoming frequent that I have to take strong measures when certain payments are not made, especially in [enforcer_county.GetNameNoTier]. So far, I've tried to use violence only as an exception, but I could serve you more effectively if I had a bit more freedom in the choosing of my methods."\n\n[enforcer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] cracks his knuckles suggestively and waits for my response."
 ek_lifestyles.0128.a:0 ""Go ahead, just don't hurt anyone important."

 ek_lifestyles.0129.desc:0 "I already suspected that my enforcer [enforcer.GetFirstName] had a rather unusual proposal when [enforcer.GetSheHe] sought me out in my private study instead of requesting an official audience. And the suggestion [enforcer.GetSheHe] made confirmed that suspicion:\n\n"A gang of thieves and other criminals has contacted me, asking for our permission to establish a presence in [enforcer_county.GetNameNoTier]. They are willing to pay us a decent sum if we allow them and turn a blind eye should their actions cause some unrest. The decision, of course, rests with you, my liege.""

I've heard that [enforcer.GetFirstName] is very good at handling such matters. Could I avail myself of [enforcer.GetHerHis] services for this? I will, of course, show my gratitude accordingly.""

 ek_lifestyles.0131.t:0 "Squeezing out the Realm"
 ek_lifestyles.0131.desc:0 "As I sit with my enforcer [enforcer.GetFirstName], counting the recent income and discussing the latest incidents, an idea strikes us both:\n\nIf it's possible to extract so much additional gold from just a few cities, couldn't the same be achieved for the entire realm using similar methods? With the right approaches, I could incentivize my officials to be much more effective in finding and taxing money. [enforcer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] could show me a trick or two to achieve that, and I could learn something in the process.\n\nThe idea sounds tempting, but such behavior would naturally also cause some unrest among those who suffer the most from it."
 ek_lifestyles.0131.a:0 "Pursue this ambition."
 ek_lifestyles.0131.b:0 "Stick to your current methods."
