 ek_lifestyles.0049.desc:0 "Lost in the pages of a treatise on shock spells, I recall the sting of the arcane backlash that set my path on this inquiry. Every mage has endured it: the miscast spell, the surge of uncontrolled magic recoiling upon oneself. It's a humbling reminder of the untamed power at our fingertips and the delicate art of its mastery.\n\nThe author claims shock to be more than just a spell: it is the manipulation of the Mundus' very weave. His theory suggests that when we cast shock, we agitate the fibers of reality, coaxing out the sparking essence of lightning itself. This perspective turns every miscast into a potential for insight, a glimpse into the fundamental workings of magic."
