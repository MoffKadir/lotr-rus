As [vassal.GetName] was awaiting an audience with me, [ROOT.Char.Custom('MudcrabStoryName')], seemingly out of nowhere, decided to attack [vassal.GetHerHim]!\n\nAn intense scream was soon heard, and after [ROOT.Char.Custom('MudcrabStoryName')] was put back outside [vassal.GetFirstName] could be seen holding [vassal.GetHerHis] hand near [vassal.GetHerHis] only remaining eye... with blood dripping.\n\n'I CAN'T SEE' could [vassal.GetSheHe] be heard screaming. 'THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, YOU AND YOUR STUPID CRITTER!'"
