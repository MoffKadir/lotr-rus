This isle, nestled between Potansa and Runcibae villages, held legendary status as the dwelling place of the Psijic Order: a revered institution known for their mastery of the Elder Way, a unique philosophy that channeled nature's forces akin to magicka.\n\nHowever, Artaeum's most enduring mystery lay in its sudden vanishing centuries ago, a peculiar occurrence coinciding with the rise of the Mages Guild in Tamriel. Theories abounded, but the truth remained obscured, safeguarded by the Psijics themselves."
