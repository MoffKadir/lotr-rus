Perhaps I had a lingering feeling that something wasn't quite right, preventing me from falling asleep. To clear my mind, I decided to take a stroll on the deck, inhaling the crisp air and gazing up at the night sky. And then, I witnessed it.\nInitially, I mistook it for an unfamiliar island until I realized this massive form was moving through the dark sea! It was challenging to discern details because the creature's skin was as black as crude oil itself, but it was large enough to obscure the stars, appearing as a shadow even darker than the night itself.\n\nI stood in shock, still unable to move, even after the creature disappeared beneath the waves and the foaming waters it left behind settled down."

Some of the people on board are screaming or praying, while others are scrambling for their weapons. However, as the massive form breaches through the waves, all action came to an abrupt halt as everyone froze in pure shock.\n\nIndeed, it was Ithguleoir, the immortal and legendary Leviathan that haunts this ocean.
