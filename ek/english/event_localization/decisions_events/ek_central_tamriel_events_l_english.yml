While the Nenalaten king, father of Laloriaran, took side with the Slave-Queen Alessia during their revolt, shortly afterwards the human-allied Ayleid city states were nonetheless destroyed or abandoned one by one. Finally only Nenalata remained.\n\nFaced with the threat of destruction, the Nenalaten split. Led by their new king, the people who would become known as the Dynari fled, while those who remained were slaughtered - the city left in ruins.\n\nNow, under [ROOT.Char.GetFullName] the ancient city ruins have been unearthed, and new Ayleid settlers have arrived to here prosper and restore the city's rightful place as capital of the kingdom."
