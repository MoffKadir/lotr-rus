 south_tamriel.0001.desc:0 "Ah, Arnesia - the mighty fortress-kingdom of the Cantemirics!\n\nFounded in the spot where the wise Oracle Cantemir allegedly reached enlightenment and gained true knowledge of the Endeavour from her Hist teachers, it served as a safe haven in an inhospitable land - alongside its sister cities of Archon and Thorn a true sanctuary from the trials of Mundus. Here the fortunes of the Cantemiric clans ebbed and flowed, never sinking beneath the waves.\n\nIn the wake of a slow decline, the Velothi have again surged forth under the lead of [ROOT.Char.GetFullNameNicknamedNoTooltip]. Sweeping away all opposition within and without, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] has annexed all lands south of the fortress until Archon, restoring the long lost Kingdom of Arnesia.\n\nNedes, Argonians and perhaps more shall see that Cantemiric walls stand strong, in stone and in faith."
