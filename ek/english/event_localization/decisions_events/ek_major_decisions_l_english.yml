 ek_major_decisions.0001.desc:0 "Our kind has rejected the mere idea of standard armies for centuries. We relied on outnumbering our enemies with clubs and other salvaged weapons, outfitting our soldiers with whatever was available at the moment.\n\nThis time must pass. It will take time and effort, and our people might disapprove of us turning back on our traditions, but we cannot rely on wave after wave of poorly-equiped warriors anymore.\n\nWe must train our soldiers, we must equip them with proper gear, and we must create an elite force that will be able to win our wars.\n\nThe survival of our people depends on it."
 ek_major_decisions.0001.a:0 "It is but the start, and we must go ever further!"
 ek_major_decisions.0001.b:0 "For the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip]!"

 ek_major_decisions.0002.t:0 "The [reformer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] Culture - Rising Might"
 ek_major_decisions.0002.desc:0 "For a long time the [reformer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] warbands were nothing more than unorganised raiders, but under [reformer.GetTitledFirstName] this has now changed. [reformer.GetSheHe|U] has succeeded in reorganising the military so that [reformer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]s are now able to form proper armies.\n\n"
 ek_major_decisions.0002.desc.same_kin:0 "This may even lead others of our kind to take arms and claim the land they rightfully inhabit. Those who oppose us will have to deal with an increased number of [reformer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] uprisings."
 ek_major_decisions.0002.desc.other_kin:0 "This could lead to an increase in the strength and numbers of [reformer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] uprisings in the lands they claim as their home, so we may have to be prepared for that."
 ek_major_decisions.0002.a:0 "This is concerning."
 ek_major_decisions.0002.b:0 "A great day for our kind!"
