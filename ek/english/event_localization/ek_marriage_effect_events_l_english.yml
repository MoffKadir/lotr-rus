 marriage_effect.2001.desc.end_reachfolk:0 "A union by oath should not be lightly made. Should we then prepare the ritual?"

While we are receving such congratulations, [inspired_courtier.GetName] approaches us, saying that our ceremony has inspired [inspired_courtier.GetHerHim]! We ponder what that could mean as [inspired_courtier.GetSheHe] asks to be considered for sponsorship."

 ek_marriage_effect.2003.t:0 "Seeking the Spirits"
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.opening:0 "The flames burn hot as the ritual is prepared. A great host of people have assembled; friends, family and of course [new_spouse.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and myself. The shaman place the required ritual components in the fire and calls upon the Hunter, the Great Spirit who is Lord of the Realm of Flesh to cast their judgement upon the married couple...\n\n"
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.great:0 "And the Hunter answers! A roaring hurrah rises from the gathered crowd, as while the signs must still be interpreted by the shaman it is clear to everyone present that this is a good omen. It speaks of great fortune caused by this union, and great blessings upon both the newlywed's clans."
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.good:0 "A great cloud of smoke rises from the flames, shifting and turning. The cloud seems to contain many colors and the wisps of smoke seem to form patterns. After a while the shaman turns towards the crowd and bellows:\n\n" "The Hunter has answered my calling, and seeks to tell us this: this union is blessed, and will bring good fortunes for both newlyweds and their clans. A good omen!""
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.bad:0 "A great cloud of smoke rises from the flames, shifting and turning. The cloud seems to contain many colors and the wisps of smoke seem to form patterns. After a while the shaman turns towards the crowd and bellows:\n\n "The Hunter has answered my calling, and seeks to tell us thus: this union is weak and ill-advised, and does not spell good fortunes for neither newlyweds nor clan. It is however not doomed, and may yet prove fruitful.""
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.terrible:0 "And no answer is forthcoming. The smoke rising from the flames is wispy and dark, and the flames are soon smothered and die away. While it is already clear to the crowd that this cannot be good, the shaman is visibly perturbed.\n\n "There is no blessing to be found for this union. It spells doom upon both the couple and their clans, and the arrangement must be undone.""
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.a:0 "Our union is truly blessed!"
 ek_marriage_effect.2003.a.tt:0 "Your spouse's family will greatly appreciate this."

 ek_marriage_effect.2003.e.tt:0 "Your spouse's family will greatly dislike this."
