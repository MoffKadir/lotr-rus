 epidemic_events.1020.desc: "[epidemic_scope.GetName|U] has devastated the people of [epidemic_county.GetNameNoTier]. [miasma_courtier.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] informs me that local trade and produce has completely dried up as the people wallow in their homes and in the streets, awaiting [epidemic_county.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetFaith.DeathDeityNamePossessive|U] call.\n\n[miasma_courtier.GetSheHe|U] blames the plague on the bad air surrounding the dead and dying, and proposes that countering it with a vast field of [epidemic_province.Custom('get_region_flower_type_plural')] would do much to dispel this bad air and slow the spread of the disease." #EK EDIT: county faith's death god rather than your character's
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.bubonic_plague: "A granular, red rash covers the skin of the infected, and blood is starting to flow from their faces. Out of the nose, the eyes and - in the end - even from the mouth.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.typhus: "The infected are extremely pale and weakened by fever. Their bones are prone to break by even minor injuries.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.smallpox: "The skin of the infected is deep red and covered in lumps and bumps. Countless fresh scars cover the skin from endless itching, and those hopeless eyes are bloodshot and red.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.measles: "The eyes of the diseased are red by the Greenspore growing behind them. They are confused and disorientated most of the time but also able to fall into a gruesome rage in an instant.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.dysentery: "When meeting the eyes of the infected, they look hollow and vacant inside, as if the spirit is elsewhere. They clutch their stomachs as if to stop them from falling out.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.ergotism: "The infected will often contort themselves in unholy dances at random intervals between bouts of mindless groaning and fouling on the streets.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.consumption: "Everywhere one goes, one cannot escape the ceaseless noise of hacking and coughing from the infected, congealed blood staining their clothes deep crimson.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.chrondiasis: "Wild magic is able to manifest around the infected. It is best to avoid them, as it is unpredictable what the disease will cause while it's feasting on the victims innate magicka.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.1100.desc.mid.peryite_affliction: "The Blighted Lord himself has marked the infected with his touch. Though they may seem normal at times, they can suddenly be seized by cramps and bouts of foul vomiting.\n\n"
 epidemic_events.5900.t: "The Knahaten Flu"
 epidemic_events.5900.desc: "Pestilence stalks the land.\n\nA grisly, red rash grows upon the victims, whose pitiful calls for help are slowly stifled as they gutter and drown in their own blood filled throats.\n\nFrom the lowliest urchin to the most fêted emperor, all dread the indiscriminate scythe of the merciless plague. Those that survive must watch helplessly as all around them perish.\n\nThe devoted look to the divine for a savior, and the powerful their riches, but none but the Argonians can truly be safe. Dreadful tendrils spread across the land, constricting it until it no longer breathes.\n\nThe Knahaten Flu is upon us. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] save us all."
 epidemic_events.5999.desc: "Missives and messages sprawl across my desk. They are all about one particular subject. The panic seeps from the words, forming in turn a rapidly rising pool of dread in my stomach.\n\nThe sickness starts with a red rash, quickly covering the whole body. Their breath comes in wretched gasps between explusions of blood, which also flows from the nose and the eyes. It then kills, indiscriminately; rich and poor, young and old, duke and downtrodden.\n\nThe reports are from far-flung lands for now, but my trembling fingers trace the dates.\n\nIt is getting closer."

 health.1015.court_physician.desc: "\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], that's the malady known as greenspore.""
