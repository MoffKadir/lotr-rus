 game_concept_court_amenities_desc:0 "$game_concept_court_amenities$ are the set standards of living in the [royal_court|E].\n\nThese are set by the [ruler|E] of the [royal_court|E], with each category (fashion, food, lodging, and servants) having several levels. Spending more on your Amenities typically yields more [court_grandeur_value|E].\n\nRulers with the [GetGovernment( 'pirate_government' ).GetName] use a unique set of Amenities, not directly granting any [grandeur|E]. They instead accumulate Grandeur via [raiding|E], and the amount of Grandeur gained is tied to their $pirate_court_court$ Amenities setting."
 game_concept_court_grandeur_desc:2 "A [royal_court|E]'s $game_concept_court_grandeur_value$ shows how famed the Court is, and unlocks new [court_grandeur_levels|E] as it increases.\n\nThe value ranges from 0 and 100, and over time will settle at its Baseline value. The Baseline is affected by things like [dynasty_perks|E], how much you're spending on [court_amenities|E], and if you have any magnificent [court_artifacts|E].\n\nA portion of Grandeur is lost upon [succession|E].\n$COURT_AMENITIES_PIRATES_NO_AMENITIES_GRANDEUR$"
