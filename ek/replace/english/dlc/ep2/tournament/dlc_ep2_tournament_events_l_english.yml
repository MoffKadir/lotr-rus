Upon this finest of days, we are blessed with the presence of a true virtuoso. [famous_knight.GetSheHe|U] has vanquished all comers from High Rock to Black Marsh! It is my honor and privilege to introduce the most skilled, the most splendorous, the best in the world: [famous_knight.GetTitledFirstName]!"\n\nA figure bursts past the herald, skidding [famous_knight.GetHerHis] horse to a standstill, a breaking ray of sunshine illuminating [famous_knight.GetHerHim] like a halo, the massed crowd's roar almost shaking the ground."
