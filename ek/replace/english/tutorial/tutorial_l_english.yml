 lesson_basics_welcome:1 "Welcome to Elder Kings II"
 lesson_welcome_desc:2 "You are a Tamrielic ruler in the [Glossary( 'Second Era', 'SECOND_ERA_GLOSS' )]'s Interregnum! Your reign may be brief, but through your heirs you can bring your dynasty to prominence. Land is yours for the taking, by way of the sword or through marriage, and clever diplomacy can extend your reach far beyond the wildest dreams of any conqueror...\n\n#TUT There is no one way to "win" in Elder Kings II, only different ways to enjoy your story as it unfolds.#!"

 lesson_basics_paused_intro_desc:1 "Elder Kings II spans hundreds of years and many generations. Right now, time is standing still because the game is #EMP paused#!.\n\n#TUT For this part of the tutorial, we'll keep the game paused while we walk you through some game concepts.#!"

 lesson_basics_quick_skills_desc: "Characters also have [skills|e]! Let's take a look at them.\n\n[diplomacy_i|e][diplomacy|e], [martial_i|e][martial|e], [stewardship_i|e][stewardship|e], [intrigue_i|e][intrigue|e], [learning_i|e][learning|e], [prowess_i|e][prowess|e], and [arcana_i|e][arcana|e] define your character's abilities.\n\n#TUT $game_concept_skills$ can change throughout the course of the game based on your actions.#!"

  lesson_basics_realm_desc:3 "If you hover over your character portrait, the coat of arms over your [realm_capital|E] ($b_daggerfall_castle$) will glow and the entirety of your [realm|E] will be highlighted. Daggerfall is your [primary_title|E], which is why your $game_concept_realm$ is named after it.\n\nYou also hold the Principality of Sword's Rest as a separate $game_concept_title$.\n\n#TUT If you zoom out, it will read "Daggerfall" on this part of the map, because you are the top Ruler of the area.#!"

  lesson_basics_map_modes_desc:1 "As a [ruler|E], you can only hold so much land on your own — you will often have other $game_concept_rulers$ helping with the administration of the [realm|E] by holding land ([titles|E]) within your borders, making them your [vassals|E].\n\n#TUT To find your own land, your [domain|E], press the 'Home' key, and zoom in. Once closer up, you can see blue labels on the [baronies|E] that belong to you (in this case it will only be $b_daggerfall_castle$).\n\nThe County of $c_shalgora$ to the north of your capital is held by your Vassal.#!"

 lesson_basics_traits_1_desc:2 "[characters|E] also have [traits|E], which can affect [skills|E], as well as how they react to things. These are illustrated by icons in the Character View.\n\nSome Traits tell you about a $game_concept_character$'s personality, like [GetTrait('fickle').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], [GetTrait('calm').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], or [GetTrait('generous').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]. Other Traits are specific to how a $game_concept_character$ has lived their life, such as an [tutorial_education_trait|E] or [commander_traits|E].\n\n#TUT You are:\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$@ambitious_icon! [GetTrait('ambitious').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$@compassionate_icon! [GetTrait('compassionate').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$@vengeful_icon! [GetTrait('vengeful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]\nFrom this, you can see that your $game_concept_character$ has great plans for her future, is generally kind-hearted but never forgets if someone did her wrong.\n\nWhen a Character chooses to behave contrary their personality Traits, it can cause them [stress|E]\n\nIn Elder Kings II, every character also has a [birthsign|E]. Donella was born under the @sign_thief_icon! [GetTrait('sign_thief').GetName( GetNullCharacter )].#!"

 ### Resources
 lesson_basics_resources_1:0 "[gold_i|E] Gold Drakes ($lesson_basics_resources$)"
 lesson_basics_resources_1_desc:2 "To further your goals you will need [gold|E]. Among other things, $game_concept_gold$ pay for [buildings|E], [armies|E], and bribes. $game_concept_gold$ are collected passively from both your [holdings|E] and your [vassals|E] as [tax|E]. Larger $game_concept_vassals$ and more important $game_concept_holdings$ tend to give more $game_concept_tax$.\n\nHowever, money can't buy everything — certain things can only be achieved by spending the right amount of [prestige|E] or, for religious matters, [piety|E].\n\n#TUT You can see the current state of your Gold Drakes, Prestige, and Piety in the bar to the top right.#!\n"

 lesson_basics_resources_3_desc:2 "With a lot of [piety|E], you will have an easier time interacting with your [head_of_faith|E]. As you are $breton_cult_adherent$, this is the Arch-Primate.\n\n$game_concept_piety$ can be gained passively from the [learning|E] [skill|E] and [virtuous|E] [traits|E] or actively from pious actions, such as going on a [pilgrimage|E].\n\nYou also have a [piety_level|E], which builds over time whenever you gain $game_concept_piety$ and can have positive effects for your Character.\n\n#TUT Similar to Prestige, some actions require you to #EMP spend#! $game_concept_piety$, like declaring [holy_wars|E] or creating a new [faith|E].\n\nSpending $game_concept_piety$ like this is normal, and other [characters|E] won't think worse of you for it.#!"

 # Lifestyles
 lesson_basics_lifestyles_2_desc:3 "Click on any [lifestyle|E] to see its [focuses|E].\n\nAs time goes by, your [character|E] will earn [lifestyle_experience|E] for maintaining a particular $game_concept_lifestyle$. When you acquire enough $game_concept_lifestyle_experience$, you can select one of that $game_concept_lifestyle$'s [perks|E] from #EMP any#! of its trees.\n\n$game_concept_perks$ represent you practicing and developing yourself over time and offer unique bonuses (like special traits) or unlock $game_concept_lifestyle$-specific mechanics and content (such as the ability to start [GetScheme('abduct').GetTypeName] [schemes|E]).\n\nThe Magic Lifestyle added by Elder Kings II will give you access to various spells to cast via a character interaction on a target character. However only those gifted or taught in the basics of magics may choose this path.$lesson_basics_lifestyles_2_reuse$"

 # Titles &  Holdings
 lesson_basics_de_jure_titles:0 "Titles ($lesson_basics_titles$)"
 lesson_basics_de_jure_titles_desc:4 "Most [titles|E] belong in a pyramid-like hierarchy, according to their $game_concept_title$ [title_tier|E]:\n\n[barony|E] — ruled by a Lord or Lady\n[county|E] — ruled by a Count or Countess\n[duchy|E] — ruled by a Duke or Duchess\n[kingdom|E] — ruled by a King or Queen\n[empire|E] — ruled by an High King or High Queen\n\nEvery $game_concept_title$ is legally part of a $game_concept_title$ one $game_concept_title_tier$ up the chain, for example each $game_concept_county$ is thus part of a $game_concept_duchy$.\n\n#TUT Note: There are many dynamic names for these Titles — your current [ruler|E] is in charge of a "Kingdom" which corresponds to the [kingdom|E] Tier. However you may encounter many differing names referring to an individual Tier. An independent ruler of the [duchy|E] Tier may be known as King or Queen. Meanwhile your [counties|E] are called "Principality" due to your general high status. Every Tier has a unique crown above their coat of arms, so you can distinguish them better.#!"

 lesson_basics_de_jure_cbs_desc:4 "We say "legally" because, as Elder Kings II lets you play with Tamrielic history, there is no way to guarantee that a [king|E] is #EMP actually#! in control of all the [titles|E] that his [kingdom|E] is "supposed" to contain within its borders.\n\nWe call this $game_concept_title$ hierarchy [de_jure|E], and if the structure has been broken it is often possible to declare war over errant territories.\n\n#TUT If you switch to the Duchy Titles map mode you can see that, as the ruler of the [duchy|E] of $d_daggerfall$, the [county|E] of $c_tulune$ should, legally, be part of your realm.#!"

 lesson_basics_holdings_and_buildings_desc:3 "The [de_jure|E] Title of Duchy Daggerfall consists of seven [counties|E]. Their names should be visible on the map:\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$$c_daggerfall$ and $c_sword_rest$ (held by you),\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$$c_tulune$ (held by a neighboring [county|E] Tier [ruler|E]),\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$$c_glenpoint$ and $c_ilessan$ (held by a neighboring [duchy|E] Tier [ruler|E]),\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$and $c_shalgora$ and $c_themond$ (held by your individual [vassals|E]).\n\nThese [counties|E] are made up of smaller pieces of land — [baronies|E], the individual [holdings|E] of a [realm|E].\n\n#TUT Holdings represent settlements in your land!\nIn Elder Kings II, some may even just represent Districts of a major city, such as in the Imperial City at the heart of Tamriel.#!"

 lesson_basics_buildings_desc:3 "[holdings|E] provide different levels of [taxes|E] and [levies|E], as well as [buildings|E] that you can construct and upgrade, depending on the [holding_type|E].\n\n#TUT We suggest you start by upgrading the #TUT_KW $building_hill_forts_01$.#!#!"
 lesson_basics_start_construction_tt:1 "Click on your Capital Holding ($b_daggerfall_castle$), select #TUT_KW $building_hill_forts_01$#! among its buildings, and #TUT_KW Upgrade#! the structure"
 lesson_basics_buildings_complete_desc:1 "Well done! It will take some time for the [building|E] to be ready though — $b_daggerfall_castle$ wasn't built in a day... Feel free to close the #EMP $building_hill_forts_01$#! construction window.\n\n#TUT Once your construction is completed, you will receive the benefits of the Building or Upgrade you chose.#!"

 #Vassals
 lesson_basics_vassals_concept_great_job_desc:2 "Here is a list of your current [vassals|E], along with some additional information about them.\n\nAt the top of the list is the [ruler|E] of $c_shalgora$, whose land you can see on the map — this is a County (a [county|E]-[title_tier|E] [title|E]) inside your [realm|E].\n\n#TUT Come here for an overview of things, such as your Vassals' current [opinion|E] of you, whether they are considered a [powerful_vassal|E] or not, and the levels of [taxes|E] and [levies|E] they are currently providing you with.#!"

 lesson_basics_happy_vassals_desc:2 "It's worthwhile keeping your [vassals|E] happy — this keeps them out of [schemes|E] and [factions|E] against you.\nIn the [autocracy_government|E] added by Elder Kings II, their opinion of you may even decide how much taxes and levies they provide to you!\n\nNo matter how mighty a [ruler|E] your [character|E] is, if your [realm|E] unites against you, either to [depose|E] you through [war|E] or just to [GetScheme('murder').GetTypeName] you while you sleep, your reign is bound to be cut short.\n\n#TUT Some of your Vassals might serve on your [council|E], making their [opinion|E] extra important, as they will be trusted with [councillor_tasks|E].#!"

 lesson_basics_hooks_complete_desc:4 "This [weak_hook|E] can be used for a number of things. For example, you can increase the [obligations|E] set by the [vassal_contract] you have with a Vassal.\n\n#TUT To access the menu for changing your Vassal Contract, go to your Vassal list in the Realm view, or right-click his portrait to choose #TUT_KW Modify Vassal Contract.#!\n\nYou may notice that some interactions are not immediately visible. When you have many interactions available, the [character|E] interaction menu only displays the most common ones.\n\nTo display missing interactions, click the "More..." button in a category.#!"

 # Domain
 lesson_basics_domain_1_desc:3 "Your #EMP [realm|E]#! is the complete body of land and [titles|E] that you control, including the areas held by your [vassals|E]. Right now, for you, this means the [counties|E] (called 'Counties', due to your Glenumbran [culture|E]) of $c_daggerfall$, $c_sword_rest$, $c_shalgora$ and $c_themond$.\n\nWhen #EMP [domain|E]#! is used, we are instead referring to the land that you own personally, without $game_concept_vassals$: $c_daggerfall$ and $c_sword_rest$.\n\n#TUT Some things that happen will only affect your [domain|E] ($c_daggerfall$ and $c_sword_rest$), while other things will impact your entire [realm|E], the [kingdom|E] of Daggerfall.#!"

 lesson_basics_quick_this_is_you_3_desc: "Next, let's take a look at your character's [traits|e]! As you can see, she is @ambitious_icon! [GetTrait('ambitious').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], @compassionate_icon! [GetTrait('compassionate').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], and @vengeful_icon! [GetTrait('vengeful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )].\n\n#TUT $game_concept_traits$ affect how your character reacts to events in the game world. You can also acquire new traits as you play."

 lesson_basics_quick_your_domain_desc_2: "This is the Coat of Arms of the [GetPlayer.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName]. It's used to represent your [realm|e] in various places. For instance, you can see it floating over your [capital|e], $c_daggerfall$.\n\n#TUT See the little crown above your Coat of Arms? That represents its [title_tier|e]. As $game_concept_title_tiers$ progress in rank, the crown atop their associated Coat of Arms will have more extravagant crowns!"

 lesson_basics_quick_your_domain_desc_3: "You currently hold a total of four [titles|e], which all represent territories on the map. Your primary, and most important, $game_concept_title$ is the leftmost one. It determines the name of your [realm|e]. You also possess the $game_concept_titles$ of Duchy and County $c_daggerfall$ and $c_sword_rest$. \n\n#TUT Hovering over the $game_concept_titles$ in your Character Panel will show you what territory they represent on the map."

 lesson_basics_quick_realm_great_job_desc: "Remember the [titles|e] we saw earlier? In this view, you can inspect the land they represent in more detail. They're [counties|e]. Depending on one's [culture|e], counties may also have different, unique name. The Redguards for example call theirs "$county_feudal_yokudan_group$". Due to your royal rank, your counties are also called different.\n\n$game_concept_counties$ (or in your case, Principalities) are made up of smaller pieces of land called [holdings|e]. A $game_concept_holding$ can support several [buildings|e], which provide various benefits."

 lesson_basics_quick_vassals_desc: "Notice how $c_shalgora$ is included in the outline of your [realm|e] on the map despite not showing up in the [domain|e] view? To explain why that's the case, we'll need to look at your [vassals|e]."

 lesson_basics_quick_done_desc: "Congratulations on completing the Quick Tutorial! The game is now unpaused, and time is progressing. From this point on, it's up to you to shape the future of House [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetName].\n\n#TUT You're free to do whatever you want to, but keep an eye out for @reactive_advice_icon! Reactive Advice appearing at the top of your screen.\n\nWho knows, maybe you can even become the High Queen of High Rock?#!"

 lesson_basics_quick_resources_time_desc: "Now that we're done talking about resources, let's wrap this up with some final pieces of advice. Right now, the game is paused. You can control how fast time progresses in the world in the bottom right corner.\n\n#TUT Elder Kings II, much like basegame CKIII, is a mod that plays out over the course of hundreds of years, so feel free to take your time.#"

 lesson_guided_final_notes_mission_step_1_desc:3 "There are many things you could do now that you have dipped your toes in some of the essential systems — Elder Kings II is about setting your own goals.\n\nIf you want a suggestion, we recommend you try and consolidate all of $k_daggerfall$! $c_tulune$ looks like an easy target, however [war|E] is not the only way, either...\n\nOr you can click the #bold Current Situation#! button up top and see if any of the items under Suggestions or Current Situation strikes your fancy!"

 # Actual Warfare

If it happens to expand your [realm|E], then so be it!\n\nUsing the character interaction system that we went over earlier, and selecting him via the map, declare war on the [ruler|E] of $d_glenpoint$. You should already have a valid [casus_belli|E], as his [title|E] is [de_jure|E] a part of your $game_concept_realm$.\n\n#TUT For a more hands on experience, we will now walk you through what happens in the flow of a war.#!"
