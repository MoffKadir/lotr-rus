 court.7600.desc:1 "My [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] [child.GetName] walks into my throne room with mud and blood caked all over [child.GetHerHis] face! I stand up in consternation, intending to rebuke my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] for [child.GetHerHis] impropriety, when $master_of_hunt_court_position$ [huntmaster.GetFirstName] strides in, similarly muddied and blood-stained, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n"My liege, [child.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] here deserves the court's praise! [child.GetSheHe|U] brought down a mighty [child.Custom('LocalAnimal')] during our hunt, perhaps the finest I've seen this year."\n\nI'm gobsmacked; had no idea [child.GetSheHe] was even hunting."
